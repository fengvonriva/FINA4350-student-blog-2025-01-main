The data ... suggests that as of now, the heaviest hitting crypto events were already behind investors by the time the FTX debacle took place.The analytics firm calculated total realized losses by looking at personal wallets and measuring the value of assets as they were acquired and subtracting the value of these assets at the time they were sent elsewhere. However, the data may still have overestimated realized losses, as it counted any movement from one wallet to another as a sale event. Chainalysis aalso noted that the chart doesnt take other statistics into account, such as user funds stored on FTXs exchange which are frozen.

Getting your audio player ready... A recent study conducted by CNBC estimated that only 8 of American participants currently have a favorable view of cryptocurrencies. Those who supported the asset class in March 2022 were 19. The market has been through a lot since then  the prices plummeted, the Terra ecosystem crashed, and FTX filed for bankruptcy. Change of Trends 43 of the US participants in CNBCs All-America Economic Survey said they have a negative view of digital currencies, while this figure was 25 nine months ago. The proponents of the asset class have shrunk to 8, down from 19, and 18 feel neutral. Despite the results, 24 of the respondents admitted having invested, traded, or used crypto in the past up 6 from the March results. 17 of those who have allocated some of their wealth in bitcoin or altcoins have a very negative stance, while 47 of the non-investors showed such an attitude. The increased criticism could be a result of the numerous adverse events that the world of crypto endured throughout the ongoing year, with Terras collapse and the crash of FTX being some of them. Former giants like Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, and many others filed for bankruptcy, while the global crypto market capitalization has slipped below 1 trillion. The rise of negativity toward cryptocurrencies coincides with record-low confidence in stocks. Only 26 of the participants believe now is the right moment to invest in equities which is the most pessimistic level in the 15-year history of the research. 51 think they should stay away. Young Americans are More Supportive A survey carried out by Bank of America estimated that 75 of American respondents aged 21-42 believe it is impossible to achieve above-average returns relying only on traditional finance. They think crypto should be one of the instruments to diversify with. 32 of the older individuals share the same stance but prefer to invest their funds in equities. Just 5 of those above 42 years old have hopped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The research further informed that 68 of the polled parents have already had an educational discussion with their children on how to transfer the family wealth to them. Generation X and Millennials are expected to inherit around 84 trillion by 2045. Those two demographic groups have been among the most active on the crypto scene. A research conducted in 2021 showed that 47 of Millennial millionaires have invested at least a quarter of their total funds in bitcoin or alternative coins. 36 said they would like to receive some of their salaries in digital currencies instead of fiat.

Getting your audio player ready... The former CEO of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX  Sam Bankman-Fried SBF  might also be involved in Terras crash. Federal prosecutors have launched an investigation to determine whether he manipulated trades that led to the collapse of UST and LUNA earlier this year. Orchestrating Terras Catastrophe, too? According to a recent New York Times coverage, US authorities have doubts that Bankman-Fried could have played a role in the collapse of Terras algorithmic stablecoin UST and its native token LUNA. People familiar with the matter revealed that he might have machinated the market to benefit the organizations he controlled  FTX and Alameda Research. His endeavors might have triggered the downfall of Terra and the consecutive domino effect in the entire industry. The investigation is still in its early days, and prosecutors have yet to determine whether or not the 30-year-old American is guilty. Do Kwon  Co-Founder of Terraform Labs  shared the report on his Twitter account, saying, whats done in darkness will come to light. The South Korean believes that Genesis Trading provided 1 billion in UST to Bankman-Fried or Alameda Research before the stablecoins depeg I think the time has come for Genesis Trading to reveal if they provided the 1B UST shortly before the crash to SBF or Alameda  the purchase from LFG was represented as stemming from interest to participate in the Terra Defi ecosystem  not to provide ammo for a peg attack. Kwon further questioned why Alameda borrowed more than 1 billion worth of bitcoin from Voyager during the depeg and why requested other leading companies to obtain over 10 million in BTC. Terra and FTX The Negative Highlights of 2022 The crash of the blockchain protocol  Terra  and that of the exchange  FTX  are undoubtedly the most negative events that took place recently. The formers problems started in May when UST lost its peg and plunged way below the target of 1. Due to the assets algorithmic nature and connection with LUNA, certain traders managed to exploit this and profit by arbitrage trading it. This essentially drove both tokens prices to virtually zero in a matter of days. As mentioned above, FTX faced liquidity issues and crashed spectacularly, triggering a market decline and colossal problems for numerous companies and individuals involved with it. For his part, SBF has given some controversial comments regarding the adverse event but has so far failed to provide concise information on how it all went down. Many, including CZ and Elon Musk essentially called him a fraudster.

The events also led to the fall of Terras native token, Terra Classic LUNC, formerly LUNA, as the two cryptocurrencies were designed to be linked. But while no one has been able to precisely determine the root cause behind the collapse of LUNC and USTC in May, it is known that the majority of the USTC sell orders came from Bankman-Frieds trading firm Alameda research, according to the NYT.A person with knowledge on the matter also told NYT that Alameda Researched also placed a big bet on the price of LUNC falling. Like with most comments Bankman-Fried has shared since FTXs collapse, the former CEO claimed that he was not aware of any market manipulation and certainly never intended to engage in market manipulation, according to NYT.To the best of my knowledge, all transactions were for investment or for hedging, he added.Related The nightmare continues for Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX  Law Decoded, Nov. 14-21 Responding to the recent report, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon shared his thoughts on the matter to his 1 million Twitter followers in a Nov. 8 tweet, who suggested it was time for Genesis Trading come clean about an alleged 1 billion loan in UST to SBF or Alameda shortly before Kwons Terra ecosystem crashed.

The infamous hedge fund, worth 10 billion at its peak, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy on July 1, with its troubles tied up in too much leverage and the collapse of Terra Luna LUNA, known now as Terra Classic LUNC, and its algorithmic stablecoin formerly known as TerraUSD UST.Since then, the liquidators  advisory firm Teneo  have been trying to hunt down the firms assets and pin down 3ACs co-founders.The latest order allowing for the subpoenas will require recipients to give up all account information, seed phrases and private keys for its digital and fiat assets details about the securities and unregistered shares and any accounts held on centralized or decentralized exchanges, along with any other tangible or intangible assets.The order also labels hedge fund attorney Hannah Terhune, directors Mark Dubois and Cheuk Yao Pau, and Kelly Chen  wife of co-founder Davies  as discovery targets, alongside trading desk company Tai Ping Shan Limited, venture capital firm DeFiance Capital, 3AC-backed nonfungible token fund Starry Night Capital and all of their associates.Related Legal team for 3AC liquidators blast founders for shifting blame to FTX, media blitz amid bankruptcyAny individuals served with the subpoena must comply within 14 days unless otherwise agreed with the parties.At the time of writing, there has yet to be reliable information on the whereabouts of Zhu or Davies.

In a Dec. 6 Twitter thread, FatMan cited bombshell data from anonymous researcher Cycle_22 that purportedly discovered two trading wallets verified to be owned by Terraform Labs had dumped 450 million worth of UST on the open market in the three weeks leading up to the depeg, explainingTFL has been perpetrating the narrative that UST was attacked. This is a false flag.In reality, TFL themselves weakened the Curve pool by irresponsibly dumping a massive amount of UST in a short timeframe. This reduced liquidity and severely weakened the peg, FatMan said.December 6, 2022 New on-chain data indicates TFL sold 450m in UST in the weeks leading up to the UST collapse, greatly exacerbating if not directly causing its demise. httpst.coijPMo0XqVt FatMan FatManTerra December 6, 2022 However, some Twitter users responding to the thread have stated it was public knowledge that TFL was withdrawing UST from a Curve liquidity pool 3Pool in preparation to seed its new stablecoin liquidity pool 4Pool. It was working with Frax Finance at the time. Twitter user RyanLion said it had been clearly communicated that the UST swaps into the curve pool were part of moves of swapping UST into other stables to purchase Bitcoin BTC for the Luna Foundation Guard reserves.A June blog from blockchain firm Chainalysis said that while Terraform Labs withdrew approximately 150 million UST from 3Pool at the time, it was the actions of two traders in the hour following  swapping a total of 185 million UST for USD CoiUSDC and TFLs response to that  that led to the depeg and resulting panic sell-off.Altcoin Business Bankruptcy Court Terra Regulation Add reaction Editors Choice Crypto.com probe by the SEC has officially closed, says CEO Market is underestimating how quickly Bitcoin will hit new ATH Analyst Chernobyl needed to wake people to AI risks, Studio Ghibli memes AI Eye Is Bitcoins future in circular economies or national reserves?

Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for co-founder Daniel Shin and seven other engineers and investors of the firm following suspicion of gaining illegal profits before the massive collapse of the Terra ecosystem.The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office in South Korea suspected that Shin possessed Terra LUNA tokens, which were pre-issued without the public knowledge of investors. In doing so, Shin allegedly bagged profits worth 140 billion won roughly 105 million by selling the pre-issued tokens during the bull market.Arrest warrants were also sought for three Terraform Labs investors and four engineers responsible for TerraUSD UST and LUNA initiatives, confirmed local media Yonhap News Agency. On Nov. 19, South Korean authorities seized assets worth over 104 million from Shin under the same suspicion of making unfair profits.At the time, Shins attorney maintained the counter-narrative, stating that Reports that CEO Shin Hyun-seong sold LUNA at a high point and realized profits or that he made profits through other illegal methods are not true. Speaking against the arrest warrant, Shin pointed outI left Terraform Labs two years before the collapse of Terra and Luna, and have nothing to do with the collapse.The seizure of funds aimed to minimize further losses for investors in case Shin decided to dispose of the stolen funds. While Kwon maintains that hes not on the run from South Korean authorities, 4,000 members of a retail investor group are attempting to track down the fugitives whereabouts.On Oct. 6, South Koreas Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Kwon to surrender his passport, which, if not done, would result in the permanent cancellation of his passport. The deadline has passed since.Related Terra Labs, Luna Guard commission audit to defend against allegations of misusing fundsA local report from South Korea claimed that prosecutors obtained evidence regarding Kwons order to manipulate the price of Luna Classic LUNC. However, a Terraform Labs spokesperson dismissed the allegations when speaking to Cointelegraph, highlighting their disappointment in seeing the Korean prosecutors continue to try to contort the Capital Markets Act to fit their agenda and push baseless claims.Unconfirmed reports suggest that Kwon moved from South Korea to Singapore before ultimately transitioning to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

It also seeks to establish a Key Employee Retention Plan to ensure the company retains trained internal resources for business-critical functions and has created an internal plan to reduce expenses.

Getting your audio player ready... A new audit report revealed that the two entities behind the Terra ecosystem, LFG and TFL  collectively spent more than 3.4 billion between May 8th-12th, 2022, to defend the peg of the fallen stablecoin. The main objective of the audit was to bring transparency into the peg defense activity and dispel reports of fund misappropriation, embezzlement, and theft. Technical Audit Report Luna Foundation Guard LFG  a fund focused on the Terra ecosystem, revealed spending 2.8 billion 80,081 BTC and 49.8 million stablecoins to defend the UST peg. A newly published technical audit was conducted by a third-party auditing firm, JS Held. The report further stated the Terra developer  Terraform Labs TFL, spent over 613 million of its proprietary capital on TerraUSDs peg defense. The paper also noted that LFG was 100 funded by donations from the former to develop exogenous reserves for Terra stablecoins. However, those reserves failed to help extreme market volatility. As a result of the exposure to the Terra ecosystem, several entities in the crypto industry, including lenders, brokers, and exchanges, had to file for bankruptcy protection. Terras Collapse Different From Other Failures Do Kwon, the controversial founder of TFL, however, believes Terras collapse is very different from the recent failures in crypto. The exec, who was issued Interpols red notice, said both TFL and LFG did everything within their resources to prevent that outcome, while this isnt the case with centralized custodial platforms whose operators misused customer funds. While there have been multiple recent failures in crypto, it is important to distinguish between Terras case, where a transparent, open-source decentralized stablecoin failed to maintain peg parity and its creators spent proprietary capital to try to defend it, and the failure of centralized custodial platforms where its operators misused other peoples money customer funds for financial gain. Kwon has been facing severe scrutiny from regulators around the world. However, he continuously slammed misinformation floating in the media and even downplayed serious charges by South Korean authorities as well as Interpol. The Terra creator has maintained weakness in the protocols design that led to its demise against the cruel market conditions and dismissed reports about insider fraud. He recently revealed his plans to meet the authorities in Europe soon. The audit comes on the same day as South Korean prosecutors investigating the algorithmic stablecoin collapse raided the headquarters of Chai Corp., the local payments technology company founded by TFL founder Daniel Shin.

Seo-joon was one of six people selected to take part in the South Korean parliaments latest inquiry to better understand the events that led to the infamous 40 billion wipe out of Terras cryptocurrencies, according to an Oct. 24 article from the Korea Economic Daily.

As told by Terra, the new proposal is designed to incentivize development in the Terra ecosystem and fix issues in the original proposal.In the original plan, around 10 of LUNAs total supply, or 100 million LUNA, would be allocated to the ecosystem, with 80 of this amount going to developer mining rewards. However, Terra staff explaine that there are only a handful of projects with total value locked on the protocol, and such lack of competition would not result in the proper distribution of mining revenue.Under the new proposal, developer mining rewards would decrease from approximately 80 million LUNA to 20 million LUNA. On the other hand, 50 million LUNA would be reallocated as liquidity mining rewards to incentivize building decentralized exchanges on the Terra ecosystem. Another 20 million LUNA would be given as developer grants, with a maximum recipient amount of 125,000 LUNA per project per year. Finally, 5 million LUNA will be given to users to incentivize traction.1 Attention LUNAtics, a new proposal has just been posted on Agora outlining a new ecosystem expansion program - The Terra Expedition httpst.cowW92766GXj Terra Powered by LUNA terra_money October 17, 2022 A seven-member committee consisting of TerraForm Labs TFL employees, community leaders and external experts will oversee the allocation of funds. The appointment period will be one year, with non-TFL employees in the group receiving a monthly compensation of 1,000 LUNA. Although the committee members will vote to decide on funding proposals, the committee, itself, will have discretionary authority over the allocation of funds.Meanwhile, the treasury will be managed by a separate group consisting of two validators, two community members and three members of TFL. A few months earlier, the Terra Luna ecosystem suffered a devastating 40 billion collapse, with the algorithmic LUNC-USTC coin pair spiraling out of control as part of a week of intense sell-offs. Since then, the ecosystem has partially stabilized but remains well below of pre-crash market valuation. According to DefiLlama, TVL on Luna currently stands at 51 million.

Getting your audio player ready... Singapore-based company Terraform Labs has stated that South Korean prosecutors exceeded the limits of their authority regarding the arrest warrant against the firms co-founder, Do Kwon. Terraform Labs also said that the Luna token is not a security, arguing that public pressure could have caused the prosecutors to amplify the definition of securities. South Korean Prosecutors Not Playing Fair A spokesperson for Terraform Labs told the Wall Street Journal in a statement saying that South Korean prosecutors were overreaching their authority. According to the spokesperson We believe that this case has become highly politicized and that the actions of the Korean prosecutors demonstrate unfairness and a failure to uphold basic rights guaranteed under Korean law. As previously reported by CryptoPotato earlier in September, a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant against Kwon and five others, claiming that they violated capital market rules. Shortly after, the Terraform Labs co-founder said he was not on the run but stated that he had no reason to make his location known to all and sundry, as the information was reserved for certain people. The Terraform Labs spokesperson in the latest report also refused to divulge Kwons location, stating ongoing physical security risks to him and his family and attempts to break into the co-founders South Korea and Singapore residences as reasons for concealing his whereabouts. Meanwhile, Singaporean authorities earlier stated that Kwon was not in the city-state. On September 26, South Korean prosecutors noted that Interpol issued a red notice for Kwon, who still maintains that he is not hiding from authorities. Amid efforts to locate the Terraform Labs co-founder, there were allegations that Kwon moved 3,313 BTC from Luna Foundation Guard LFG wallets to KuCoin and OKX. He refuted the claims. Luna is Not a Security Terraform Labs has also argued that Luna is not legally classified as security, which meant that the token was not under South Koreas capital markets law. According to the firm, this would also mean neither Do Kwon nor the company carried out any illegal operations. The spokesperson said We believe, as do most in the industry, that Luna Classic is not, and has never been, a security, despite any changes in interpretation that Korean financial officials may have recently adopted.

Secondly, the price has been forming a rising wedge, or a bearish reversal pattern, since Sept. 9.LUNAUSDT daily price chart featuring rising wedge breakdown setup.

It resolves after the price breaks below the lower trendline together with a rise in trading volume.As of Sept. 11, LUNA was testing its wedges lower trendline for a potential breakdown move. In this case, the price will risk falling by as much as the wedges maximum height. In other words, LUNA could drop to 4.5, down 30 from the price on Sept. 11.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

If passed by Terraform Labs TFL, the 1.2 tax burn will be activated by September 20.

KuCoin, in the latest announcement, stated that its services related to LUNC and USTC will remain unaffected if the community chooses not to approve the proposal. The Seychelles-based crypto exchange has suggested users to deposit all Terra Classic tokens to avoid increased deposit fee costs. KuCoin will support the 1.2 tax burn when the proposal is officially approved and implemented on Terra Classic LUNC mainnet.

Getting your audio player ready... The fall of the fourth largest cryptocurrency began with an unannounced transfer of funds between trading pools on the night of May 7. It left the Curve pool with an imbalance on the side of Luna. This anomaly could have been set right as its not an entirely uncommon phenomenon. But in this case, the situation turned from bad to worse, writing off one of the most infamous network collapses in crypto history. In an interview, Do Kwon admitted that he believes there was a mole inside this team and the crucial blow to the network came from an insider. Within 13 minutes of the liquidity imbalance, some unknown traders sold off 200 million of UST. The trend continued through the next morning, which left the trading pool with a lingering imbalance and UST value wobbling from 1 to 99 cents. The UST had lost its peg to the dollar, although the margin was not significant. Luna May Mayhem The sentiment on Twitter started to get worse And then there started to be more people that were trading against the Curve pools, Kwon recalls his morning after the big trade that exposed the liquidity crunch at the Terra Luna ecosystem. In a knee-jerk reaction, Kwon, who goes by the Twitter handle stablekwon, infamously tweeted, Anon, you could listen to Crypto Twitter influensooors about UST depegging for the 69th time. Or you could remember theyre all now poor, and go for a run instead. Kwon felt helpless at containing the attack as his executive team was up in the air flying to Singapore to attend a quarterly meeting at Terraforms headquarters. Kwon admitted that the timing of the fund transfer and the absence of key Terra executives due to a scheduled official engagement was inside information. The only people that knew that were TFL employees. So if youre asking me whether there was a mole at Terraform Labs, thats probably yes, he said. Inherent Vulnerabilities The interview deals with other issues central to the Terra Luna network. For example, UST-Lunas algorithmic pegging, in contrast to stablecoins backed by hard cash and why people will hold their dollars in UST if there is nothing more to it, were the questions that led the network to bet big on unviable Anchor Savings Protocol that promised 20 annual returns. It catapulted Terra to the top league but promising 20 returns while banks gave only 1  2 was unviable. There was only one solution for the network to keep it from going bust  a continuous flow of funds into Anchor through larger adoption. When the anonymous traders struck on May 7, Anchors runway was down to only 45 days before it would need another injection of cash. And because this was all playing out on a transparent blockchain, anyone could see the end of the road looming there on the horizon. When a Terra community member proposed a 1 billion top-up in April, Kwon coyly replied Sounds low, Coinage pinpointed the final moments before the trigger for the biggest fall in crypto history was about to unfold.

OKX, which claims it managed to protect its users against losses from LUNA and UST, tells us more. 1733 Total views 6 Total shares Listen to article 000 Sponsored COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEEDIts been a bruising few months for the crypto markets. But with things beginning to stabilize, theres now an opportunity to take a step back and figure out what lessons can be learned.Here, OKX director of financial markets Lennix Lai tells us about the steps crypto businesses need to take to protect investors, what the industry should be doing differently, and how the bear market has affected the behavior of its customers.1. Hello! Tough question to begin with Does the crypto industry have a trust issue?When it comes to the recent liquidity crisis that has significantly affected lenders, I think there is absolutely an issue. The problem is that money managers have been opaque when it comes to how they are investing with users funds.To solve this, we need to find a way to separate clients tokens from managers in-house wallets while ensuring that those managers fulfill their duties to both their clients and the related communities. Investors need to have knowledge of how their funds are being staked, traded or used as collateral.2. What needs to be done to protect investors?Investors need both better transparency into how their funds are being invested and better control over how those investments are being handled. Platforms like OKXs Custody Trading Sub-Account fix this trust issue by giving investors visibility into how their funds are being invested, as well as granting them controls that include trade-freeze level and kill switch.The industry also needs a renewed focus on risk management. At OKX, we are providing exactly this by acting as a third-party custodian for investors and their funds.3. And weve seen something of a contagion effect, with the downfall of one project affecting others?The crypto crunch were seeing started with LUNA, which offered very high yields for investors. From there, weve seen other high-yield prospects and lenders like BlockFi and Celsius crashing. The liquidity squeeze is whats contagious. 4. Weve seen issues surrounding smart contracts that havent undergone audits. What is OKX doing to address this?OKX has an internal team that runs smart contracts for DApps that are listing on our Earn platform. Were also taking a look at third-party auditing for smart contracts.5. Have you noticed any differences in customer behavior since the bear market began? Many users have become less active and quieter in general. Investors are also lowering their leverage.6. What are the biggest lessons that should be learned following this crypto winter?Everyone has learned that even the biggest financial managers can get into trouble. Lenders will have learned not to underestimate the liquidity risks of various tokens, like in the case of Celsius with ETH 2.0.Despite all of this, Im confident that the industry will evolve. The solution here might be on-chain, or it might come from exchanges like us acting as third-party custodians.DeFi is also being criticized, but DeFi protocols have been liquidating positions just as their smart contracts dictate. The problem has been people becoming too obsessed with generating high yields with DeFi.7. You claim you were the only exchange that protected investors against LUNA and UST losses. How did this work? Yes, thats true. OKXs risk management systems detected the impending crash days before it actually happened, and then began to alert users and release their assets so they could be traded or sold. This was made possible because OKX has both a dedicated risk detection task force and some of the best risk-management protocols in the industry. Altogether, OKX protected more than 500 million UST belonging to more than 9,000 users.8. Do regulators need to ensure that retail funds are separated from institutional funds in the crypto space? Funds should be separating client monies from house funds. That is a standard requirement. 9. What are your top priorities for protecting crypto investors in the next 12 months? Were going to keep doing what weve been doing  that is, to continue enhancing our risk management systems, to continue undertaking smart contract audits and to keep educating users with our responsible trading programs.Learn more about OKXDisclaimer.

Getting your audio player ready... A plethora of NFT projects, devs, and their ecosystems were left stranded in the Terra wreckage. Two months later, almost 50 crypto projects and their coders based on the fallen network have now found a new home in Polygon. The projects include P2E metaverse, Lunaverse, the A.I. generated NFT universe, DystopAI, and Terras more successful PFP collections such as Hellcats and Babybulls. In a tweet, Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt confirmed the numbers stating that these projects have allied to move to the Polygon network. It was so awesome to help and welcome all these wonderful developers to our thriving ecosystem! Welcome! Several competing blockchains had tried to woo developers whose work was endangered by the Terra implosion. Wyatt had also stated that Polygon will be putting capital and resources against these migrations to welcome the developers and their respective communities to the platform. The layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum unveiled a relatively uncapped multimillion-dollar fund shortly thereafter. Polygon planned to finance the fund with the help of the recently raised 450 million led by Sequoia Capital India. Terra-based NFT marketplace OnePlanet was the first one to receive funding from Polygon. The team, which consisted of around 30 people, has moved to the blockchain. Interestingly, OnePlanet has also been helping other NFT projects migration via a new initiative called  ArkOne. After considering key factors such as mass adoption, market opportunities, stability, and foundation-level support, OnePlanet announced partnering with Polygon to become a dedicated marketplace for all migrating Terra NFT projects to the Polygon ecosystem. Meanwhile, another high-profile metaverse P2E game, Derby Stars, has migrated to Polygon.

Getting your audio player ready... In the aftermath of Terras historic debacle, regulatory scrutiny targetting the stablecoin industry through cooperative measures across borders has become urgent to authorities worldwide. According to a recent report, South Korean Justice Minister Han Dong-hoon has discussed with US officials potentially enhancing cooperation in fighting against security fraud and financial crimes. Strengthening Ties on Crypto Regulations Han Dong-hoon met chief officials from the US Securities and Commodities Task Force during a visit to New York on Tuesday, nodding for a cooperative investigation with the US agencies on the potential crimes involved in Terras collapse. The partnership aims to strengthen information exchange across borders, doubling down investigative efforts on crypto and other financial crimes. In particular, Terra  the project being probed in both countries  is under the spotlight again The two sides also agreed to share their latest investigation data on ongoing crypto cases, including the high-profile case surrounding the meltdown of stablecoin TerraUSD and its digital coin counterpart, Luna. The fall of Terra has caught legal scrutiny from global authorities. Last month, Korean prosecutors launched an investigation on the team, looking into possible fraud charges and market manipulation. Reportedly, a key member of the group was even banned from leaving the country. Meanwhile, the SEC  the top US securities watchdog  expanded its scope of investigation on the Terra-based DeFi platform Mirror Protocol. The regulatory entity believed the protocol could have violated the Securities Act by offering investors to transact tokenized versions of popular stocks like Tesla and Airbnb. In addition, the agency also looked into if the co-founder and CEO of Terra  Do Kwon  had violated the investor-protection regulations when he promoted UST and Luna before they collapsed. Cross-Border Partnerships Last week, the UK and US issued a joint statement on strengthening regulatory outcomes for digital assets across jurisdictions. Both authorities expressed concerns regarding the role of stablecoins and crypto-asset trading and lending platforms as the broader market downturn has revealed issues rooted in some problematic projects. This came in the wake of crypto firms falling apart largely due to overly leveraging their existing assets during the bull market. As the bear market hits the industry, some have to file bankruptcy or claim insolvency as their debts pile up and their crypto positions get liquidated.

Getting your audio player ready... Uprise Investment Fund became the latest cryptocurrency company to be affected by the LUNA crash, with over 20 million worth of funds getting liquidated while short-trading the asset during its crash in May. According to a local news report on Tuesday July 6, 2022, Uprise suffered huge losses after entering a short sell position for LUNA using clients funds. As a result of the violent market volatility, the company lost about 26.7 billion won 20.4 million, amounting to 99 of customers funds. Uprise also lost 3.9 billion won 2.9 million of its own assets. Meanwhile, Uprise is looking to compensate customers, with a spokesperson for the firm stating It is true that damage to customer assets has occurred due to unexpected great volatility in the market. We plan to finalize the report on virtual asset business soon. The Korean firm runs a crypto trading desk that invests clients funds in the cryptocurrency futures market. Uprise also has an ETF investment platform called Iruda. Uprise, backed by South Korean venture capital giants like Kakao Ventures and KB Investment, uses AI-infused robo advisor technology for its crypto trading. Meanwhile, the crash of Terras native coin LUNA that occurred back in May has caused a contagion affecting several cryptocurrency companies exposed to the fallen token. One of such firms, struggling crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital 3AC, saw its 200 million investment in LUNA devalue following the tokens price plunge.

Getting your audio player ready... CoinLoan  a company that offers crypto-backed loans and interest-earning accounts  said it will balance the flow of funds on its platform by reducing the account withdrawal limits. The firm assured that the amendment is temporary as each user would be able to withdraw up to 5,000 per 24-hour rolling period. CoinLoans Steps Amidst the Market Pullback The Estonia-based cryptocurrency lending platform  CoinLoan  became the latest firm in the field to announce some changes due to the adverse market conditions. Its temporary measures include the reduction of withdrawal limits. The company said a suspension of all withdrawals is not on the agenda since some customers have stored their life savings on CoinLoan. The procedure will allow the platform to conduct stable operations in the future as sometimes prevention is better than cure. The crypto lender also stated that it has no exposure to distressed protocols such as Terra, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius. The reason is simple  our strategy bars risky activities that could endanger CoinLoaners funds, the entity explained. The team also assured its users that their assets were safe. Being one of the oldest CeFi platforms in the field, CoinLoan has seen numerous negative events and is confident that its expertise will guide it through the current chaos Since 2017, we have seen multiple adverse situations, but each of them gave CoinLoan strength and contributed to its growth. We understand how to handle difficulties, and we are also well-equipped to prevent them. Companies That Took a Major Punch The ongoing crypto winter has significantly harmed leading digital asset exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Bybit. Because of the diminishing investor interest, all those had to lay off a chunk of their employees. The Singapore-based trading venue Vauld and the lending firm BlockFi were also affected. The former dismissed 30 of its total personnel and suspended all transactions and withdrawals. Earlier today July 5, CryptoPotato reported that Nexo is willing to acquire the troubled entity. BlockFi also had to make some redundancies among its staff. Additionally, the State of Iowa ordered it to pay an administrative fine of nearly 1 million for failing to register as a securities trading platform. Amidst all these issues, FTX an exchange spearheaded by Sam Bankman-Fried displayed its intentions to purchase BlockFi. Interestingly, the offer was for a mere 25 million considering the fact that BlockFis latest known private valuation hit 3 billion. Later on, Ledn revealed similar plans as it aims to lead a 400 million fundraiser and provide a 50 million equity contribution that could grant it a significant proportion of BlockFi.

Getting your audio player ready... The past few weeks have been particularly detrimental for the cryptocurrency industry as major market participants experienced massive challenges. One of the largest centralized lending platforms  Celsius  still hasnt unpaused withdrawals, whereas leading cryptocurrency hedge fund  Three Arrows Capital  filed for bankruptcy. Amid all this, rumors are running rampant on a daily basis and the latest to get under the radar was crypto exchange KuCoi. An anonymous Twitter account thats gaining a lot of attention lately has recently urged users to withdraw funds from KuCoin immediately. Within hours, the tweet received hundreds of retweets and thousands of likes. On the other hand, CryptoPotato recently reported that the CEO of FTX  Sam Bankman-Fried  argued that there are some third-tier exchanges that are already secretly insolvent. Many industry participants started spreading the rumors and even though KuCoin is unlikely to be considered a third-tier exchange, people were speculating rampantly. The CEO of the exchange, Johny Lyu, took the opportunity to quickly dismiss those rumors and reiterate that KuCoin is operating as usual and even hiring more people. Be aware of FUDs! Not sure whos spreading these sheer rumors, and what their intentions are, but KuCoin does not have any exposure to LUNA, 3AC, Babel, etc. No immense suffer from any coin collapse, no plan to halt withdrawal, everything on Kucoin is operating well. The CEO also reiterated that they are one of the few platforms that are still hiring, while also saying that they recently raised 150 million at a 10 billion valuation just this May. Being transparent is always one of our key principles. We will soon publish our 2022 H1 review report where you can know more about our operations. For FUDers who intentionally spread unverified info, KuCoin reserves the right to take legal actions.  Lyu added.

Notably, LUNA2 came to existence in late May as a means to compensate investors who had suffered losses during the collapse of Terras algorithmic stablecoin, now called TerraClassic USD USTC.

But the implosion of the Terra ecosystem drove the agency to include LUNA. Getting your audio player ready... According to South Korean media Money Today, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is expanding the scope of its investigations into the Mirror Protocol to add LUNA. SEC Vs. Terra In the latest development in legal tensions, the SEC has sought LUNA-related documents from Terraform Labs as well. In a parallel investigation launched last month, the regulatory entity had been looking into potential Securities Act violations. But the legal tensions between Terra ecosystem and the SEC date back to September 2021, when Kwon was served with a subpoena as he exited an escalator at Messaris Mainnet conference. The actual issue was the Terra-based decentralized finance DeFi platform  Mirror Protocol  on which synthetic crypto-versions of popular stocks like Tesla, Microsoft, and Airbnb, are minted and traded. Kwon had Initially denied receiving the subpoenas. But later sued the SEC and claimed that the subpoenas were improperly issued and served. In February this year, a New York court ordered Terraform Labs and its CEO to comply with the subpoenas. Following this, Kwon filed an appeal overruled on June 8 by a US court, stating he and his company are required to comply with investigations by the SEC into the Mirror Protocol. Kwon argued that the TFL lacked sufficient presence within US markets and that the subpoena should have been delivered to the execs legal counsel, not him personally. Upholding the February ruling, the United States Court of Appeals justified the SECs actions by pointing out TFLs numerous marketing and promotion to US consumers, retention of US-based employees, contracts with US-based firms, as well as business trips to the country related to Mirror Protocol. As part of the ruling, the TFL and Kwon were required to present all necessary documents related to the DeFi protocol and provide testimony to the SEC. But there was no mention of LUNA-related documents previously. Legal Troubles Mounting legal woes and a bear market have been proving to be a tough year for the Terra ecosystem. South Korean prosecutors have imposed travel restrictions on former and existing Terraform Labs employees from leaving the country amid the ongoing investigation. A former Terraform Labs developer, Daniel Hong, confirmed the report and explained that they were not notified earlier about the same. He said, None of us were notified of this at all when I found out about this, the South Korean prosecution told me they usually dont notify people of this because they might destroy evidence andor leave the country beforehand. Tbh people being treated as potential criminals like this is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable bet anyone who was willing to cooperate would no longer want to after this madness.

Getting your audio player ready... The five leading cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea  Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax  will reportedly set up a joint consultative body that will oversee the local digital asset market, scheduled to go live during the second half of 2022. Trying to Prevent Another Accident Like Terra A local media revealed that Koreas major platforms will join forces to grant additional protection for crypto investors. They vowed to sign a business agreement and then launch a joint consultative body to improve the regulatory standards in the space. They will also create a communication channel where victims and affected companies could address arising issues. The consultative body will be divided into three areas transaction support, market monitoring, and compliance monitoring. The first action is scheduled for September this year, when the exchanges will prepare a virtual currency warning system and delisting standards. Additionally, the companies will provide valuable information, including evaluation reports and white papers. If there are any indications that certain cryptocurrency projects are related to money laundering activities or they pose a threat to the financial system, investors will receive a warning. In October, the platforms plan to introduce guidelines for listing screening. They will also periodically check the possible risks in the market and act urgently in need. Subsequently, from January 2023, new crypto investors will not be allowed to enter the ecosystem before completing the relevant educational video. South Korea has been in the spotlight of the digital asset scene because of last months fiasco surrounding the local blockchain platform  Terra. Its native token  LUNA  and its algorithmic stablecoin  UST  crashed to virtually zero. As a result, numerous investors lost millions, and some even committed suicide. The Korean Authorities are Acting, too Earlier this month, the South Korean financial watchdogs urged for applying comprehensive rules in the cryptocurrency sector so cases like the LUNAUST crash could be prevented. Yun Chang-hyun  a lawmaker and leader of the ruling People Power Partys virtual assets committee  insisted on conducting a meeting with the top five exchanges so they could together design a regulatory framework. In his view, the domestic digital asset industry was neglected for too long without order and discipline, which could be one of the reasons why such crashes occur. So far, four platforms have confirmed they want to participate in that meeting. They also promised to release official announcements if any guidelines were set up.

Wallet That Caused the UST Attack Suspected to Belong to Terraform Labs Report Inside Job? Wallet That Caused the UST Attack Suspected to Belong to Terraform Labs Report Author Jordan Lyanchev Last Updated Jun 14, 2022  1308 An investigation of the TerraUSD and LUNA fiasco from last month shows that it could have been an inside job. Getting your audio player ready... Terraform Labs grabbed the attention of the entire crypto community last month when its two native digital assets deteriorated in days, leaving only a failed restarted project. However, a recent investigation completed by security company Uppsala Security indicated that the wallet behind the attack is connected and managed by Terra itself. Last month, Terras algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its peg supposed to be redeemable 11 with the dollar and allowed investors to profit by arbitraging it against LUNA. In a matter of days, the prices of both assets plummeted to pennies, and this downfall caused a market-wide panic and sell-off. New information continues to emerge frequently regarding what precisely transpired. Most recently, the US and South Korea launched investigations, and numerous watchdogs have outlined plans to incorporate regulations on the industry and stablecoins in particular. The first part of the investigation by Uppsala Security shows one address that has been implicated as being responsible for the initial run against UST and its de-pegging. The company labeled it Wallet A and determined that it could be owned or controlled by Terraform Labs TFL or Luna Foundation Guard LFG themselves, or their related parties. The investigation showed several accounts that were somehow involved in what transpired, all linked, including some on Binance and Coinbase, as well as how they transferred UST, USDC, and USDT between each other. Wallet Connection in TerraUST Collapse. Source Uppsala Security The first act that triggered the de-pegging occurred when a wallet associated with TFL removed approximately 150m of UST liquidity from Curve pool. Later, Wallet A swapped 85m of the algorithmic stablecoin for USDC in the same Curve pool and transferred the new funds to a Coinbase user address, which is hard to follow without the exchange revealing user information. Instead, Uppsala Securitys data shows that Wallet As funds on the Ethereum mainnet came from the Terra mainnet via the Wormhole. The related wallet on Terra was identified as terra1yl Wallet AT. Wallet AT was depositing UST into a specific Binance account linked to a destination Memo 104721486. It started receiving UST earlier this year and had obtained almost 124 million UST by May 25, most of which came from Wallet AT. Wallet AT deposited a total amount of 108,251,326 UST into Memo 104721486 on 20220507 alone, the day when the de-pegging of UST began. Total of 10 incoming transactions were made into Memo 104721486 leading up to 20220507 2144 UTC, when TFL first removed 150m of UST liquidity from Curve pool, which raises the possibility that Wallet AT and Memo 104721486 may have been aware of the upcoming UST liquidity removal. The first address that transferred UST to Memo 104721486 was identified as a wallet controlled by LUNC DAO due to a tweet from the team. This address terra13s had previously sent 19M LUNA to another one terra17p, which had transferred 100M LUNA to terra1gr  wallet operated by LFG as confirmed. Another user wallet on Binance Memo 100055002 had received 2,665,579,215 UST until May, and terra13s, as well as terra1t0, were the first and early depositors. The second picture shows more of the connection between all addresses. Commenting on the findings, Uppsala Security CEO  Kim Hyung-woo said As a result of analyzing various on-chain data about the Terra incident, it was confirmed that not only Wallet A but also the wallet connected to it were managed by Terraform Labs and related companies. As it appears to be, there is a need for regulators to investigate related exchanges such as Binance. Wallet Connection in TerraUST Collapse.

Getting your audio player ready... A new class-action lawsuit filed against the US branch of the largest cryptocurrency exchange alleges the company of misleading investors and illegally allowing the sale of unregistered securities  LUNA and UST. Filed in the Northern District of California on Monday by law firms Dontzin Nagy  Fleissig and Roche Freedman, the lawsuit reads that Binance USs business model is premised on illegally enabling the sale of unregistered securities to as many US investors as possible, as often as possible. This is because the exchange listed and started selling TerraUSD UST in the middle of April, but the controversial stablecoin was an unregistered security. The lawsuit further alleged the exchange that it participated in direction promotions of UST by airdropping free tokens to increase trading volumes. Binance US also writes news updates on price movements of the UST and links to stories about the UST published across the Internet, adds the suit. These tactics have managed to increase the number of transactions on the exchange and thus the fees paid to it, the lawsuit also alleged. The Terra collapse caught most of the cryptocurrency space by surprise, especially given the suddenness of everything that transpired. Essentially, the algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg supposed to be redeemable 11 with the USD, and users were able to profit by arbitraging it against LUNA. In a matter of days, both assets plummeted to pennies, causing mass panic across the entire market. The aftermath continues to this day as authorities from several countries are going after the company and its founders. Some even began proposing specific regulations focused on stablecoins.

Getting your audio player ready... The founder and CEO of Terra, Do Kwon, has refuted recent claims that he has cashed out a whopping 2.7 billion before the fiasco that led to UST losing peg and LUNA crashing to 0. Well-known anonymous Twitter account FatManTerra made another massive allegation yesterday, arguing that Do Kwon, the founder, and CEO of Terra, cashed out a whopping 2.7 billion over the span of months prior to USTs depeg in May. FatMan alleges that Do Kwon had used Degenbox  a borrowing protocol in the Abracadabra ecosystem, allowing users to stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Ancor, then used the staked UST aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor once again, and so forth  a loop. Hours later, Do Kwon took it to Twitter to completely refute the claims, slamming them as categorically false. This should be obvious, but the claim that I cashed out 2.7B from anything is categorically false.  He said. He also said that for the last two years, the only thing Ive earned is a nominal cash salary from TFL, and deferred taking most of my founders tokens because a didnt need it and b didnt want to cause unnecessary finger-pointing of he has too much. FatMan didnt stop there, though. Following Kwons response, the account continued insisting on the founders wrongdoings, asking further questions that are yet to be answered. Caught.

Getting your audio player ready... Several memes and slurs were made at a time when Terra was positioning itself as a DeFi juggernaut. But after the coin crashed to nothing, many assumed that the market may have finally humbled Kwon. For the most part, it did seem like it. Now that the rebranded LUNA lost over 77 of its value since its inception, the remaining investor confidence is evaporating quickly. Over the past 24-hours alone, the token has lost 20, and hence, tension is palpable. Amid all this, CEO and Founder Do Kwon took his account private, allowing only select followers access to his tweets. The reason behind the move is unclear, but substantial harassment that the founder has been receiving over the past couple of weeks could have driven him to go private. Legal troubles for the Terraform Labs continued, and many predicted that Kwon may face prison time for the crypto wipeout last month. The South Korean police also reportedly revealed investigating an employee of Terraform Labs for embezzlement of corporate funds. The Seoul police received intel regarding the suspects alleged fraud, following which they launched a full-scale investigation. The authorities have asked exchanges to freeze the employees accounts. The development comes a month after the first cracks in the now worthless TerraUSD UST began to appear. Only time will tell if Terras Luna 2.0 will avoid the fate of its predecessor, but with Kwon going into hiding, chances of a meaningful surge appear slimmer.

Getting your audio player ready... The crash of Luna and TerraUSDT and the launch of Luna 2.0 have unleashed a wave of taxation issues for investors in India. While the Terraform Labs team has worked out a recovery plan and launched Luna 2.0 to compensate for the losses, concerns are piling up. Gift Tax on Luna 2.0 Airdrop In a recent analysis, Bloomberg throws a spotlight on the taxation issues that Luna 2.0 airdrop brings along. Since Luna 2.0 has been provided free of cost as an airdrop, itll be treated as a gift and will attract applicable tax provisions. It means, at the time of filing tax details, investors will have to disclose the value of the airdropped Luna 2.0 and pay up the gift tax, the analysis noted. They tax authorities normally consider the most aggressive view possible with a view to collecting higher taxes, notwithstanding the fact that such a view may result in absurdity, the Bloomberg report quotes Jay Sayta, a technology and gaming lawyer, as saying. Capital Gains Tax on Profits The problem doesnt stop here. Any gains on crypto transactions are to be taxed at a flat 30 with effect from April 1, 2022. The investors will have to pay a 30 capital gains tax when they sell their Luna 2.0. As losses on crypto transactions are not allowed to be offset against profits, losses on Luna will not be compensated with the profit from Luna 2.0. The wordings in the law are so vague, including the definition of virtual digital asset and the definition of transfer, that it would be open to litigation of challenge by the tax department, Sayta adds. After losing all the investments in Luna and UST, the airdrop brings additional tax obligations to keep in mind.

Getting your audio player ready... Anders Helseth, a Senior Analyst at Arcane Research, filed an entry on May 30th, claiming that Terraform Labs dumped LUNA tokens on retail users during the collapse of UST. If the Terra Ecysostem was a sinking cruise ship, the captain and distinguished guests fled in superyachts, leaving most passengers behind without lifeboats.  Opens the post. Helseth tracks down the flaws of the Terra Classic Protocol back to its genesis, claiming that no block rewards and a highly concentrated LUNA supply gave all power to the early holders. Arcane Research shared a pie chart of LUNAs distribution as of October 3rd, 2020 Source Arcane Research The analyst claims that he has analyzed value flows in the Terra Ecosystem and has accounted for transactions up to May 5th right before the crash to avoid obscurity. The analysis reveals that sets of John Doe wallets interacting closely in clusters have massive net outflows from the Terra ecysostem to bridges and centralized exchanges. He claims that theres a common denominator among these clusters  one or more wallets in the cluster received significant transfers from Terraform Labs wallets. From October 2020 to May 5th, 2022, said clusters comprise net outflows of over 6 billion through bridges and exchanges. On the other hand, all the other hundreds of thousands of wallets have a net inflow of 6.5 billion. What is more, he also argues that the clusters deposited large amounts of LUNA to exchanges when their price was still relatively low, making outflows undervalued relative to inflows of LUNA. The report also details that the algorithm behind UST allowed these LUNA whales to mint large amounts of UST and benefit from the 20 yield on Anchor protocol. That yield was what created the massive demand for UST, providing the necessary exit liquidity for the clusters  argues the research.

Getting your audio player ready... Jump Crypto  the crypto dedicated arm of Jump Trading  has released a report analyzing the early stages TerraUSD USTs de-pegging event. The company, which was heavily involved with Terras blockchain, found that a small set of whales were responsible for triggering USTs initial price pressure. Low Liquidity on Curve According to the report released on Thursday, the de-pegging event began on Saturday, May 7th, when a series of critical transactions was conducted in the UST3CRV Curve pool. Within a 75-minute timeframe, Terraform Labs TFL withdrew 250 million in UST liquidity from the pool. Meanwhile, two anonymous whale addresses swapped a total of 185 million of UST back into the pool, in exchange for USDC. The transactions left the pool very low on liquidity overall and were followed by a flurry of activity, within. Earlier in the same day, one of those same wallets had transferred 108 million worth of UST to Binance. This coincided with elevating trading volumes at Binance and worsening liquidity at Curve. Trading volume refers to the amount of security or cryptocurrency being traded at a given time. Meanwhile, liquidity refers to the availability of an asset in the market. When assets are low on liquidity, it is easier to create price spreads and shift their prices with singular, large transactions. We do not know who controls Wallet A, said the firm, referring to the wallet that dumped UST on Binance. They traded in large size, but their activity differs from what would be expected from an active or sophisticated trading operation. Abandoning Anchor Protocol The second set of contributors were large withdrawals from Anchor protocol  a popular lending service on Terra that allowed users to borrow and lend UST. Anchor held 72 of the UST supply in the weeks leading up to Terras fall about 12 billion worth, due to its highly attractive 19 APY. Jump reports that large outflows of UST were detected leaving Anchor protocol overnight on Saturday, May 7th, and again in the late morning of Monday, May 9th. The outflows  which together pressured UST meaningfully off peg  were driven primarily by large depositors. By contrast, small depositors were found to increase their exposure to Terra in those three days. Finally, the simultaneous pullback in the crypto markets at the time further enforced USTs price deviation. Due to risk-off market sentiment following the Federal Reserves interest rate hikes, investors were exiting positions in Bitcoin and all of crypto  including UST. In the days leading up to Terras collapse, co-founder Do Kwon retweeted a post echoing a similar theory about the event, claiming that the de-peg was a deliberate short attack on the ecosystem. As of now, the community has launched Terra 2.0, which has abandoned the use of an algorithmic stablecoin entirely.

Getting your audio player ready... The Parliament of Japan reportedly passed legislation that will put stablecoins under enhanced scrutiny. The initiative aims to give local investors further protection when dealing with such assets. Japan Sees Stablecoins as Digital Money According to a recent Bloomberg report, the Japanese authorities issued new guidelines on stablecoins. The lawmakers granted the assets a legal status, recognizing them as digital money. However, stablecoins must be pegged to the countrys national currency the yen or another legal tender to be categorized as such. The newly-passed bill means that only authorized banks, trust companies, and money transfer agents can issue that type of token. The directive does not apply to the largest stablecoins by market capitalization  Tether USDT and USD Coin USDC  but only to stablecoins issued by Japanese enterprises. Currently, no local exchanges issue such products. Japans Financial Services Agency explained the legislation will become effective in a year. At the same time, stablecoin issuers will be put under the authorities scope in the following months. The necessity for new rules in the space could be prompted by the recent collapse of Terras algorithmic stablecoin  UST. Last month, the token lost its peg and is currently trading at a mere 0.02. The crash caused significant panic in the crypto sector, while numerous investors parted with colossal sums. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust to Issue a Stablecoin Earlier this year, the Tokyo-based financial services company said it plans to create a stablecoin tied to the value of the Japanese yen. The asset could enable Mitsubishi UFJ Trust to improve its payment processes by settling securities transactions. The endeavor could also propel the usage of blockchain technology in securities trading. The Japanese Trust Bank has promoted its employment in a partnership with Daiwa Securities and SBI. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust is the banking arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The latter is Japans largest monetary organization and one of the worlds leading bank holding companies, managing assets of over 3 trillion.

Getting your audio player ready... Jesse Powell  CEO of Kraken  explained on Friday why his exchange decided to list Terra 2.0 despite the collapse of the original chain. Many in the crypto community showed skepticism of the move, given Terras loss of credibility over the past month. Listing Isnt Endorsement When questioned about the listing, Powell explained that he primarily went forward with it due to client demand. He argued that exchanges like Kraken must stay competitive by ensuring that all major tokens can be traded in one place. Not supporting 1 coin people demand could cost you the entire account, he said. Listing isnt an endorsement. Kraken was one of many exchanges to announce a listing for Terra 2.0 on the day of its airdrop. Other major platforms included Binance, KuCoin, FTX, and Bitfinex, among many smaller alternatives. Some found the move extra surprising coming from Powell, however, who has shown strong agreement with the Bitcoin community on ethical issues in the past. Surrounding Terra, many Bitcoiners such as CoinMetrics co-founder Nic Carter were loud critics of its stablecoin model both before and after its collapse. Carter was the first to question Powell about the move. After Powells response, MIM podcast host Brad Mills continued the discussion, claiming that Powells listing erodes reputation with Bitcoiners. Powell justified the move by claiming to be as asset agnostic as possible, helping to facilitate price discovery rather than pick winners and losers in the market. He did, however, note that Kraken has a bar for listing cryptos, that less than 2 of tokens successfully pass. Terra 2.0 meets his threshold, as he doesnt believe it has the same security flaws as its first rendition. I agree itd make a good topic for an Intelligence report, he added. Powells Past Stances Powell stood firmly with Bitcoiners in his decision to not list BSV  a Bitcoin fork created by a man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto. The man, named Craig Wright, has launched numerous lawsuits against those that denied his identity as Bitcoins creator. Powell said he was sued in 2020 for not naming BSV as BTC at Kraken, but chose to keep it delisted anyways. The CEO was also supportive of the Bitcoin community movement to fund Canadas freedom convoy protests in February. He warned donors at the time to remove their coins from his exchange, or else hed be forced by the Canadian government to freeze their accounts. In April, Kraken became one of the first major crypto exchanges to support lightning network Bitcoin transactions, enabling faster and cheaper deposits and withdrawals.

I try not to predict what the community will do. ... Many are skeptical. Im one of those guys, said CZ in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. Following the collapse of TerraUSD USD, the Terra ecosystems stablecoin, CZ criticized its team for not handling the crisis properly and pointed at the projects flaws that led to the crash. Still, Binance is now actively participating in Terras revival plan by hosting the airdrop of its new LUNA token. As CZ pointed out, despite the widespread skepticism around the Terra relaunch, Binance has a responsibility to help users affected by the crash of LUNA. We still need to ensure continuity of peoples access to liquidity. ... We have to support the revival plan hoping that it may work, he explained. According to CZ, the Terra fiasco should serve as a warning to projects that rely on unsustainable business models based on aggressive incentives. As he pointed out, crypto projects such as Terra offer high yields to attract people in the hopes that once there are enough users, they will become profitable. We should really look at them in a fundamental way to measure that more revenue, more income is generated than just an incentive payout, CZ pointed out.

Getting your audio player ready... Tron founder Justin Sun recently penned a blog post reflecting upon the lesson he learned from Terras notorious collapse. According to him, over-collateralization is essential for maintaining the stablecoin peg, and a high yield marketed as an incentive isnt sustainable in the long run. Transparent Over-Collateralization Matters The founder of the Tron Network  Justin Sun  decided to launch the USDD stablecoin after he had witnessed the exponential growth of Terras UST, according to the founders latest blog post. Suns USDD follows a similar algorithmic mechanism as UST did, allowing users to burn 1 of TRX in exchange for the right to mint 1 USDD. Yet, the founder considered such an approach risky as UST was largely backed by its sister token LUNA, with less than 15 of the asset collateralized by BTC. The reserve consisted of just 3b of BTC at its peak, hardly enough to collateralize the nearly 19b UST supply. During the bank-run over the last two weeks, LFGs collateral barely made a dent in the overwhelming UST sell pressure.  To learn from this mistake, the TRON DAO Reserve has held a combination of high-quality and low-volatile assets, including USDT, USDC, BTC, and TRON to back USDD, with the collateralization rate being maintained at the 180-200 range. To demonstrate its high transparency, TRON DAO Reserve will release the details regarding the type and amount of collateralized assets. Currently, the Reserve holds approximately 295m in USDT, 82m in BTC, and 181m in TRX. In particular, the founder noted that its network has the largest supply of fiat-backed stablecoins USDT issued on-chain, which plays into a critical strength compared to Terras ecosystem. 20 APY Isnt Sustainable Speaking of achieving long-term and stable growth for the USDD ecosystem, Sun commented on USTs 20 fixed yield, saying it was unsustainable. Instead, Tron will separate the staking process into two parts, with phase one containing a maximum of 2 billion USDD mintable. During this phase, users could earn 30 APY for staking the algorithmic stablecoin. In phase two, there wont be any imposed supply cap. The post stated that lenders and stakers who have locked up USDD on decentralized exchanges for 1-year will continue to receive a high yield, while those who only locked up their assets for a shorter timeframe will receive a lower rate. Yet, Sun did not provide a specific number for the high yield in the post. In addition, the Reserve aims to hold a total of 2 billion worth of assets as collateral by the end of phase one and escalate the amount up to 10 billion in the long run. In terms of the roadmap ahead of the newly launched stablecoin, Sun said the Reserve will focus on liquidity, for now, making sure that more USDD trading pairs are available on decentralized exchanges while deepening partnerships with centralized exchanges. In the long run, the stablecoin will support multiple chains and challenge the dominance of USDT and USDC.

This comes as Binance also processed the airdrop. Getting your audio player ready... The native token of the recently-launched iteration Terra 2.0 soared in value over the past 24 hours. This comes as LUNA is now trading live on the leading cryptocurrency exchange  Binance. As CryptoPotato reported a few days ago, Terra 2.0 launched and successfully started producing blocks. Multiple exchanges supported the airdrop for LUNA holders and, subsequently, enabled trading services for the new token, and the price went on a rollercoaster, skyrocketing to 30 on some platforms and declining all the way down to 4 hours later. With that said, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by means of daily trading volume  Binance  only enabled LUNA trading a few hours ago after having finalized the airdrop to its users. In an announcement from earlier today, the exchange noted Binance has completed the Terra LUNA airdrop distribution to Terra Classic LUNC and TerraClassicUSD USTC holders. In the past 24 hours, the price of LUNA has gone on a tear, skyrocketing by around 42 at the time of this writing.

The exploit was observed on Sunday by governance participant Mirroruser on the protocols forum. As of the time of writing, the Mirror BTC mBTC, Mirror Polkadot mDOT, Mirror Ether mETH and Mirror Galaxy mGLXY synthetic asset pools on the protocol have lost almost all of their assets valued at over 2 million. Mirror allows trading of synthetic assets such as stocks and cryptocurrency on the Terra and Terra Classic layer-1 blockchains, BNB Chain and Ethereum. A pricing error for Luna Classic LUNC made the exploit possible. The remaining validators on Terra Classic reported that the price of LUNC at 0.000122 was the same as the newly launched Terra LUNA 9.32, even though their real market prices vary wildly according to CoinGecko. Chainlink community ambassador ChainLinkGod explained on Tuesday that the Terra Classic validators were running an outdated version of the oracle software. .mirror_protocol has just been exploited again due to Terra Classic validators reporting the price of the new Terra 2.0 LUNA coin 9.80 instead of the original Terra Classic LUNC coin 0.0001This is a massive operations failurehttpst.cohO0M0UFBYq httpst.coygbr3ij4iS pic.twitter.comPO0huxX8oQ ChainLinkGod.eth ChainLinkGod May 30, 2022 Venus Protocol and Blizz Finance each suffered from a similar exploit in May when price oracle Chainlinks reported LUNA price remained at 0.10, while the market price ran far below that. Blizz Finance was entirely drained while Venus lost 11.2 million. Terra community whistleblower on Twitter, pseudonymous FatMan, warned that the Mirror exploit will affect the other m asset pools by about 800 am UTC on Tuesday. However, the account also claims that most of the pools can be saved if the developers intervene to fix the bug. By 1255 am UTC, it appeared that the pricing error had been fixed for LUNC, as the price being verified by the oracle has returned to its real market value. This is the second time Mirror has suffered from a major vulnerability. The previous bug in Mirrors code was exploited hundreds of times since 2021, according to FatMan in a Friday tweet. The first exploit allowed a user to unlock other users collateral on the protocol and pull it out themselves. In all, the first exploiter got away with well over 30 million and was not noticed until May 2022, he added.

But there may be a silver lining. Getting your audio player ready... Amidst the market-wide chaos, it is the mid-sized Bitcoin holders that have held on to the old investment adage of buy the dip. Data suggested that entities holding less than 100 BTC in their wallets appear to have raked in all of the dumped Bitcoins. Fetching Dumped Bitcoins The de-pegging of UST forced Luna Foundation Guard LFG, the entity created to support the Terra ecosystem, to liquidate over 80k BTC. This ensued a crypto bloodbath that was exacerbated by Terras failure to resuscitate both tokens values. As a result, investors found their portfolios dipping into the red. However, the crypto analytic company, Glassnode revealed that the volume of supply held by entities with less than 100 BTC has increased by 80,724 BTC since the fateful day nearly three weeks ago. During the LUNA triggered sell-off in early May, a total of 80,081 BTC were liquidated by the Luna Foundation Guard. Interestingly, the volume of supply held by entities  100 BTC has since increased by 80,724 BTC. This shows a transfer from LFG, to 100 BTC holders. pic.twitter.comI9mlxVrOFA  glassnode glassnode May 30, 2022 Luna Foundation Guard Under Investigation Both the platforms associated with Terra are now under massive scrutiny from the South Korean regulators. The police had asked cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze LFGs accounts and prevent withdrawals of corporate funds held at these platforms. The authorities are now looking into the details of cash and crypto transactions. The Financial and Financial Securities Crime Joint Investigation Team of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office have also reportedly launched an investigation on Terraform Labs and its co-founders. Despite big restoration efforts, Terra 2.0 has been up to a rocky start. The new token  LUNA  was airdropped last week. Several crypto exchanges came forward and announced support for the recent revival plan. The token has been on a wild ride, surging from 0.5 to 30 and then dropping all the way down to 4 on some exchanges. It is currently trading around 5.4 at the time of this writing.

Bitcoin BTC, Ether ETH and especially altcoins now appear to be undergoing a major reset, down 50 or more from November highs. Some worry that a whole generation of crypto adopters could be lost if things crumble further. If the market decline continues, it will become too painful and retail investors will bail, Eben Burr, president of Toews Asset Management, told Reuters earlier this month. Everyone has a breaking point. But, all the gloom and doom could be overdone. Its unnerving, acknowledged Callie Cox, United States investment analyst at eToro, but its only par for the course for a market that scarcely existed a decade ago. Bitcoin, arguably the most institutionalized digital coin, has actually gone through 16 drops of 50 or more over the past 10 years, she told Cointelegraph. The current correction hasnt deterred younger investors, according to Cox. We surveyed 1,000 investors across age groups in March, and 58 of investors ages 1834 thought Bitcoin would present the best buying opportunity in crypto over the next three months. Still, more recently, in early May, Glassnode reported that 40 of Bitcoin holders were underwater on their investments at a time when BTC was 33,800 it was 29,000 this past weekend on May 28. Are younger investors still as optimistic as they were in March? Retail traders between 35-45 years old decreased their crypto balances amid market volatility in the last few weeks, Bobby Zagotta, CEO of Bitstamp USA and chief commercial officer at Bitstamp Global, told Cointelegraph. By contrast, Our younger users seem to be more bullish and have chosen not to sell. He added Given the macroeconomic headwinds, every asset class is risk-off right now. That said, crypto and Bitcoin, in particular, are showing pretty amazing resilience. Has LUNAs collapse shaken newcomers? Not everyone is so sanguine, however. During the last bull run, retail investors were increasingly drawn to the most speculative investments, perhaps hoping to duplicate the spectacular gains of cryptos earliest adopters, Lennix Lai, financial markets director at crypto exchange OKX, told Cointelegraph. Ether and Bitcoin are down some 50 from their late 2021 peaks, but many altcoins have plummeted even further. Meanwhile, the mid-May collapse of Terra LUNA and TerraUSD UST has shaken the whole crypto sector, said Lai, adding The devastating impact of the LUNA crash will certainly have soured cryptos perception among less sophisticated investors  the damage done to retail sentiment will take time to recover from. Still, Lai doesnt believe that retail investor trust in cryptocurrencies has vanished. Rather a lesson has been learned. Bearish markets teach everyone that the nature of crypto  in addition to other asset classes  is volatile. Recent How Terras collapse will impact future stablecoin regulations Are the young inherently optimistic? In a 2021 paper, two researchers explored the impact of investors beliefs on cryptocurrency demand and prices. Focusing primarily on the 20172018 bull market, they found that younger individuals with lower income are more optimistic about the future value of cryptocurrencies, as are late investors. In particular, fear of missing out, and contagious social dynamics may have contributed to a rampant increase in cryptocurrency prices. Could the same dynamic be at play in the late 2021 price run-up? I would speculate that not much has changed in terms of how educatedsophisticated the average crypto investor is, Giovanni Compiani, one of the papers co-authors and assistant professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Cointelegraph, given that, to my knowledge, there havent been any major education campaigns or any policy changes that would make it harder for unsophisticated investors to trade. If this is the case, then one might expect these late-comers or younger-aged crypto enthusiasts to be bailing out around now, but that isnt necessarily happening. When asked about first-time retail investors, Cristina Guglielmetti, financial adviser and president of Future Perfect Planning, told Cointelegraph The clients I have who own cryptocurrency havent really sold their holdings from last year to this year. Theyre looking at it more as an educational experience and not assigning an expected return per se. Theyre expecting it to be speculative and very volatile. Will new customers be hard to find? Even if latecomers arent fleeing en masse, wont it still be difficult to attract new retail customers given the scorching some have suffered? Weve seen crypto bear markets before, said Zagotta, just as weve seen rallies. We are a part of a new financial ecosystem developing minute by minute and led by some of the smartest minds of our time, so my bet is always going to be on innovation versus stagnation. Moreover, he told Cointelegraph Headlines might have you believe that theres more volatility than there really is and that investors are fleeing when prices fluctuate. But, thats not really happening. Cryptos issue isnt necessarily price, its education, said Cox. Forty-two percent of investors surveyed by eToro in March said they dont buy crypto because they simply dont know enough about it But, the appetite for decentralization and digital transformation is still there, especially among younger investors. Cox does not accept the assumption held by some that younger investors are flighty and quick to run at the first resistance. On the contrary, younger investors naturally have higher risk appetites, and theyve seemed willing to stomach these swings because of their longer-term optimism about the technology. Although some investors will be lost for good, each market cycle sees newcomers becoming believers in the technology, added Lai. Investors who abandoned crypto in 2018 and returned in 2021 are more likely to stick around, as they now realize that the industry doesnt die during market downturns and that investments made during the lows have historically been most lucrative. Meanwhile, the open interest at OKX keeps increasing even when the market is bearish, indicating that users are not leaving the market, said Lai. We do expect investors to lower their leverage and maintain their positions, however. Are retail customers even needed? Maybe were worrying too much about individual investors. Last week, JPMorgan Chase, the banking giant, was reported to be experimenting with blockchain technology for collateral settlements. If large institutional players like these are bullish on the technology, maybe it doesnt even matter what retail investors do? Both retail and institutions are critical for the continued adoption of digital assets, said Zagotta. Institutional interest certainly establishes maturity and confidence towards all other investor classes. What really matters for the industry is that good products are delivering real value to users, added Lai. Institutional is only part of the ecosystem, though a crucial part. The presence of institutional players in the sector fosters fair pricing of crypto assets and better liquidity. What advice, if any, would Lai offer new crypto investors? DYOR, or do your own research. Crypto is still an emerging asset class with a relatively short history compared to the traditional finance market. Some of the tokenomics, despite being very promising, are still experimental. Recent Digital identity in the Metaverse will be represented by avatars with utility Know what youre investing in, added Cox. Investors have different goals, needs and risk tolerances. So, ultimately, crypto may not be right for your money at this moment. There are risks to investing in an emerging asset class. Overall, the crypto story is a compelling one, she continued. The world is moving toward a decentralized future generally, and cryptocurrencies are more inclusive and accessible relative to traditional financial instruments. Focus on the utility of each coin youre investing in, and always have an exit strategy in place, Cox concluded. Most agree that more education is needed. Our data shows that 76 of retail investors are excited to see crypto reaching mainstream status within a decade, said Zagotta. That means that we see a massive opportunity to support adoption through education. Education and knowledge will create trust amongst regulators and investors. In sum, We havent seen investors abandon the crypto space en masse, said Cox, but we have seen them become more selective of what crypto they buy.

Additionally, Binance  the worlds leading cryptocurrency exchange by means of trading volume, has still to launch LUNA trading, which is set to begin in two days  on May 31st.

The network has produced its first block, and additional services are expected to go live soon. Terras team took it to Twitter today to reveal that the new chain has officially gone live and is already producing blocks. Block 1 of the brand new Terra blockchain with a chain_id of Phoenix-1 has officially been produced at 0600 AM UTC on May 28th, 2022! The team also revealed that users are currently able to do multiple things with their liquid LUNA, such as staking it to preferred validators, earning rewards, participating in government decisions, and so forth. Its also worth noting that this is a new blockchain and not a fork, therefore, decentralized apps from the classic chain would need to relaunch on the new one. With that said, one of the most pressing questions that many people are wondering is if centralized exchanges and service providers will support the airdrop. There are numerous platforms that have already announced they will, and these include, but are not limited to Huobi, Binance, KuCoin, Bitrue, FTX, Bitfinex, GateIO, ByBit, Nexo, and so forth.

Source TradingViewThe plunge comes after two years of a sustained uptrend, with ETHBTC rising more than 200 between September 2019 and December 2021.As Cointelegraph reported, Ether outperformed Bitcoin in recent years, largely due to the hype surrounding its long-awaited protocol upgrade, called the Merge, which hopes to make Ethereum more scalable and less expensive.But the upgrade, which aims to transition Ethereums blockchain from proof-of-work to proof-of-stakea counterpart known as Beacon Chainhas faced repeated delays in its launch. Only recently, Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine- EVM-compatible Gnosis chain, highlighted a seven-block reorganization on the Beacon Chain, meaning that the chain got briefly forked in its testing phase.The Ethereum beacon chain experienced a 7-block deep reorg 2.5h ago.

CZ Binance cz_binance May 26, 2022 Historically, Bitcoins dominance drops during crypto bull markets as waves of new tokens spring up during the mania phase. For instance, the duration of the infamous initial coin offering ICO pump coincided with BTC.D dropping from nearly 96 in January 2017 to 35 in January 2018.BTC.D daily price chart.

Therefore, if Bitcoins market dominance has indeed bottomed out, it could once again align with a macro bottom in Bitcoin price, and possibly the beginning of a new bull market phase in the coming months.

After the community voted in to have the terra ecosystem essentially forked without the algorithmic stablecoin, the team has now revealed the launch date for the protocol and the LUNA airdrop. Terra 2.0 is Launching on May 28th As CryptoPotato reported yesterday, Terra 2.0 has been agreed upon and voted in by the community with a majority. One of the key differences between the protocol-to-be and its previous iteration is that the team will not be creating an algorithmic stablecoin in a bid to prove that Terras ecosystem is more than just UST. In an official Twitter thread, the team revealed further details, including the date for the airdrop, when were the snapshots taken, and when the new protocol will launch. Yesterday, we said Terra 2.0 is coming. Tomorrow, it arrives. The community has been working around the clock to coordinate the new chains launch. Subject to potential change, we expect Terra to go live on May 28th, 2022 at around 0600 AM UTC. The first block of the new chain will be produced following a supermajority of interconnected validators running simultaneously. Per the thread, the block explorer, as well as Terra Station, and the feeder of dApps Terra Observer will all be fully functional once the chain is up and running. What About the LUNA Airdrop? Undoubtedly one of the most commonly discussed topics of late is the airdrop to LUNA and UST holders as a means of compensating them for the losses incurred during this months fiasco. According to a Medium post, eligible holders of LUNC Luna Classic, USTC UST Classic, and aUST  will receive the LUNA airdrop on the new chain upon genesis. Per the post The amount of LUNA you will be eligible to receive will be determined by the types of tokens you held on the Terra Classic chain, the time period that you held these tokens based on Pre-Attack and Post-Attack snapshots, and the quantity of tokens held. The two snapshots in question were taken as per the following schedule Source Terra Medium SPECIAL OFFER Sponsored Binance Free 600 CryptoPotato Exclusive Use this link to register a new account and receive 600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance full details.

Getting your audio player ready... PeckShield  blockchain security and data analytics company  has identified scammers sending so-called Wrapped LUNA 2.0 tokens to high profile Ethereum addresses. The ploy is meant to imitate the actual LUNA re-launch airdrop taking place on Friday. According to an alert from PeckShield, popular recipients of these new tokens include Vitalik Buterin, Andreesen Horowitz, Three Arrows Capital, and Justin Sun. The tokens were initially sent to Terra Deployer from an anonymous address on Thursday and then sent to the relevant individuals, in order to imitate Terras official airdrop. However, as Do Kwon made clear in his Terra ecosystem revival plan, UST and LUNA holders with assets bridged off of Terra are likely not to be eligible for the airdrop. In other words, so-called airdrops taking place on Ethereum and other chains are fraudulent. Terras plan involves forking the Terra blockchain and issuing an all-new LUNA token. The old LUNA  which was debased to nothing after UST de-pegged from the dollar earlier this month  will be renamed LUNC. The new LUNA will be distributed to holders of LUNC and UST based on their positions during certain snapshots of the blockchain. Users with holdings stored at exchange addresses  like Binance or Huobi  will also be compensated. Terra 2.0 will not include an algorithmic stablecoin like the last chain and will be completely community-owned. Neither Terraform Labs nor the LUNA Foundation Guard is included in the airdrop whitelist.

Getting your audio player ready... The collapse of the much-hyped cryptocurrencies of the Terra ecosystem devastated many investors, but not the investment firms that cashed out right before it all came crashing down. There are many lessons to learn from the failed project as retail traders grapple with devastating losses. Ethereums co-founder Gavin Wood said that people should pay more attention. At the backdrop of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos, the executive said, I would hope that people pay more attention to what is belying the currency name when they get involved in a community, ecosystem, economy. In the interview, Wood also said that the internet has no real concept of legality because it is something that is determined by sovereign nations. Observing the market-wide rout, Wood said that technology cannot prevent people from making mistakes but can help those who want to understand better the facts of the world, and what theyre buying. LUNAs crash may have gravely exacerbated the declines in the cryptocurrency market this year, but many blockchain companies are breaking stereotypes at the ongoing world economic forum. Web3 is being thrust into the limelight despite the legacy finance worlds apparent contempt for the digital asset industry. With crypto being a rather hot topic following TerraUSDs at the worlds biggest business tables, International Monetary Fund IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva hinted at the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and sister token LUNA and said that stablecoins not backed by assets are a pyramid scheme. During the panel discussion at WEF, Georgieva said, When we look at stablecoins, this is the area where the big mess happened. If a stablecoin is backed with assets, one to one, it is stable. When it is not backed with assets, but it is promised to deliver 20 return, its a pyramid.

Getting your audio player ready... Earlier this month, the crypto industry suffered a huge setback after Terras algorithmic stablecoin UST depegged from the US dollar and caused LUNA to lose 99.9 of its value. Shortly after the crash, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon proposed a revival plan for the Terra ecosystem. It centered on forking the current chain, abandoning UST, and creating a new token that will be distributed to investors based on the losses they incurred during the catastrophic event. Do Kwon Shares Burn Address The proposal was met with skepticism from members of the crypto community who suggested that Terra should burn LUNA instead to reduce the circulating supply of the asset. As the pressure from the community continued to mount, with the hashtag LunaBurn trending on Twitter, Kwon decided to satisfy the wishes of the people on Saturday, May 21. He shared a burn address for LUNA, which would automatically burn any LUNA token sent to it and effectively reduce the circulating supply in the market. Do Kwon Makes U-Turn Interestingly, Kwon tweeted two days later that sending LUNA tokens to the burn address he had sent earlier will do nothing to improve the state of the digital asset. He then advised LUNAtics the nickname for LUNA investors not to send their tokens as they will only lose them. To clarify, as Ive noted multiple times I dont think sending tokens to this address to burn tokens is a good idea  nothing happens except that you lose your tokens. Want there to be no confusion whatsoever, Kwon said. Despite claiming that he didnt want to create confusion, publicly sharing a burn address and advising against sending tokens to the burn address two days later had already created confusion. Pointing this out, one user asked Kwon why he had shared the burn address in the first place since he claimed it was pointless. He replied, saying People kept asking for the burn address  happy to provide for information purposes but want to clarify that you should not burn tokens unless you know what you are doing  i for one cannot understand  Do Kwon  stablekwon May 23, 2022 MEXC Pushes Forward With LUNA Burn Plans Meanwhile, Singapore-based crypto exchange MEXC Global plans to initiate a LUNA buyback and subsequent burn. The exchange intends to use the fees generated from LUNAUSDT spot trades to purchase LUNA in the secondary market, which will then be burned. However, the execution of the plan will be determined by the outcome of community votes. MEXC is delighted to offer a special recovery plan dedicated to the LUNA community. We need your decision in deciding whether we should buy back LUNA and proceed with LUNA burn in order to decrease LUNA circulation on the market, the exchange said.

Instead, the part of the community recommended burning LUNA as the most plausible way to achieve a comeback.Kwons proposal to preserve the Terra ecosystem involves hard forking the existing Terra blockchain without the algorithmic stablecoin and redistributing a new version of the LUNA tokens to investors based on a historical snapshot before the death spiral. However, several crypto entrepreneurs, including Changpeng CZ Zhao, opined thatReducing supply should be done via burn, not fork at an old date, and abandon everyone who tried to rescue the coin.Upon a persistent request from the crypto community, Kwon went against his initial plan and publicly shared a burn address for LUNA on Saturday. Every LUNA token sent to this address will be burned immediately, effectively reducing the circulating supply of LUNA tokens.To clarify, as Ive noted multiple times i dont think sending tokens to this address to burn tokens is a good idea - nothing happens except that you lose your tokensWant there to be no confusion whatsoever httpst.coGrzG9cclAr Do Kwon stablekwon May 23, 2022 Two days after sharing the LUNA burn address, Kwon reiterated his point of view that reducing the circulating supply of LUNA tokens will have no impact on the market price, stating, nothing happens except that you lose your tokens.The Terra co-founder clarified that the burn address was shared with users only for information purposes and warned against using itHappy to provide for information purposes but want to clarify that you should not burn tokens unless you know what you are doing - I for one cannot understand.However, the revelation resulted in more confusion among investors. As Cointelegraph previously reported, LUNAs insane volatility serves as a lucrative opportunity for investors as many try to recoup their losses and others eye profitable trades.Kwon has previously confirmed that Terra is no longer minting new LUNA, which is one of the main reasons why investors believe a burning mechanism will improve LUNAs price owing to scarcity. Amid an unclear roadmap for a resolution, investors are advised to refrain from making abrupt financial decisions as the master plan for Terra revival continues to be under public scrutiny.Related Near Protocol picks up slack, onboards Tracer following Terras downfallAs a direct consequence of Terras collapse, numerous projects sought to migrate to different blockchain ecosystems fighting for survival.

Getting your audio player ready... The cataclysmic fall of the Terra ecosystem last week wiped nearly 40 billion off the cryptocurrency market, leaving UST and LUNA investors both retail and investment firms in severe losses. As those affected by the crash are seeking ways to either move on or take legal action against Terras Do Kwon, leading crypto research and investment firm Delphi Digital has detailed how the LUNA-UST fiasco rendered its investments worthless. Worst Event Since Mt Gox In an official post earlier this week, Delphi noted that Terras crash is the most catastrophic event in the crypto industry since Mt Gox, a defunct Bitcoin exchange that lost 850,000 BTC to hackers in 2014. Delphi stated that while it was a big fan of the Terra ecosystem, it always had concerns about the structure of UST and LUNA. However, the firm believed that the sizable reserves held by the Luna Foundation Guard LFG would prevent the collapse of the project. We always knew something like this was possible, and we tried to stress the risks to a system like this in our research and public commentary, but the fact is we miscalculated the risk of a death spiral event coming to fruition. Weve taken some heat for this over the last week, and we deserve it. The criticism is fair and we accept it, Delphi wrote. Delphi Suffers Large Unrealized Losses The crypto investment firm went on to detail how the Terra crash had affected each of its various arms. It noted that its venture capital arm, Delphi Ventures Master Fund, had purchased a small amount of LUNA equivalent to 0.5 of its net asset value NAV in Q1 2021. It gradually increased its exposure to LUNA and other Terra-native assets, including a 10 million investment in the LFGs funding round in February. Delphi said it did not sell any LUNA during the crash and is currently sitting on a large unrealized loss. Suffering the worst blow was the companys research and development arm, Delphi Labs, which had spent several months working on joint ventures building Terra-based protocols, Astroport and Mars. Delphi Labs received grants of 30,000 LUNA and 466,666 UST from Terraform Labs to support its work, all of which it still holds. Learning From the Lesson As for the future, after making a big bet on Terra and failing, we want to make sure we learn our lessons and make the right choice on where to focus our efforts. Weve put together a cross-sectional team of some of our brightest minds across Research and Labs and well be taking our time to ensure we assess all possible options and make the right long-term decision. Delphi noted that while the latest Terra saga has deeply affected its balance sheet, it is making moves to bounce back and leave a positive impact on the industry with its new projects. Anyone who knows us  as a business and as individuals  knows how heartbreaking it is for us to see the space we fight so hard to push forward be set back by events like this. We stand committed to doing whatever we can to leave a positive impact on crypto and the world. Weve always said actions speak louder than words, so well let our work and efforts do the talking for what comes next, the firm concluded. Avalanche Loses 60 Million Meanwhile, Delphi Digital is not the only crypto firm that has reported large unrealized losses in the aftermath of Terras fall. Emin Gün Sirer, the founder of the Avalanche blockchain, said the project has about 60 million tied up in Terra. Recall that in April, Terraform Labs announced a partnership with Avalanche for a 100 million token swap to bolster the UST reserve.

Gox Avalanche Founder Compares LUNAs Collapse to Mt. Gox Author George Georgiev Last Updated May 20, 2022  1429 Avalanche Founder Emin Gun Sirer compared the fall of UST and LUNA to the hack of Mt. Gox. Getting your audio player ready... The collapse of Terras ecosystem  more specifically, the depeg of UST and the subsequent crash of LUNA  are undoubtedly cryptos hottest story in 2022 and perhaps even beyond. Speaking on the matter was the founder of Avalanche  Emin Gun Sirer. He noted how Terras previous growth affected other blockchains and what its collapse meant for the AVAX ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency community. Terras Growth Suppressed Other Chains In an interview with Forbes Steven Ehrlich, Emin Gun Sirer  the founder of Avalanche  revealed his thoughts on the massive growth of Terra in the past year and the recent UST  LUNA collapse. The Terra situation is highly regrettable. As you know Terra started out slightly before we read Avalanche did and it just blossomed. It ended up attracting a lot of the money and a lot of the growth of the space that would have gone to either AVAX or maybe Solana or some of the other latest-generations high-speed chains started going to LUNA. He explained that at some point, projects such as Avalanche were getting choked by LUNAs fast growth. This, in turn, caused many other chains to copy developments on Terra. His team, though, steered clear from undertakings of the kind. We were smart enough to notice that we couldnt do this. There are many reasons why not, but running a stablecoin of that kind with those kinds of feedback loops, it takes an enormous team with operational ability to try to keep that peg. We knew that we didnt have that ability. Sirer assured that there are no US-based teams that can deliver the regulatory structure for such an initiative. Swapping 60M in AVAX for LUNA and UST Before the Crash Realizing that Terras growth shouldnt be ignored, Sirer said that they decided to partner up with them through a token swap. He pointed out that they swapped some 60 million worth of AVAX for LUNA and UST tokens in a bid to form a partnership with Terra. This would, however, turn out to be a losing bet. The founder shared that all of their LUNA tokens essentially went to zero, but they were able to redeem a part of their UST for dollars. Despite all of the above, he also said that this didnt cause any economic challenges for Avalanche because the sum was insignificant and that it can be cleared in a day. On the other side  he also shared that theyve been in talks with the team behind Terra, and the AVAX that they swapped for hasnt been dumped, but instead  its the most valuable thing they hold, and he doesnt foresee them selling it going forward. Compared to Mt.Gox Avalanches founder also compared the fall of UST and LUNA to a distant event  one that was also particularly devastating for the broader industry  the hack of the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange. Sirer also spoke of the DAO hack  another watershed moment in cryptos relatively young history  but said that comparison to Mt. Gox is more accurate. I would compare it to Mt. Gox. I think the Mt. Gox crash was far more significant, it affecte dmore coins, more people. Now, we as an industry, ended up learninga valuable lesson about algorithmic stablecoins. What I fear, though, is that this kind of event invites in regulators.

Getting your audio player ready... The Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC  Gary Gensler  opined the turbulence in the digital asset market has not ceased with Terras fiasco. He predicted that a lot more coins will fail, which will harm an additional number of investors. The Turmoil is Not Over Yet The cryptocurrency market has significantly declined in the last few weeks. Bitcoin, for one, is down by over 25 in the past 14 days. However, all eyes were on Terras native token LUNA, which crashed from nearly 80 to less than a cent in a matter of days. The projects algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its peg against the US dollar and is currently trading at 0.08, which many believe was the original source of the aforementioned crisis. According to SECs Chair  Gary Gensler  crypto traders should be prepared to see other coins failing to virtually zero. Thus, they could lose their funds, while their confidence in the digital asset industry will be undermined I think a lot of these tokens will fail. I fear that in crypto theres going to be a lot of people hurt. In addition, Gensler reiterated the SECs plans to put crypto platforms under strict monitoring. The agency insists that all trading venues be registered with the financial watchdog. Presumingly, this way, investors will have maximum protection when dealing with cryptocurrencies They should move towards getting registered or, you know, were going to be the cop on the beat, and were going to bring the enforcement actions. Gary Gensler, Source Bloomberg SEC Hires More People to Strengthen Its Crypto Unit Earlier this month, Americas top monetary regulator vowed to almost double the size of its Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit. It will be topped up with 20 experts, and the total number will surge to 50. The additional positions include staff attorneys, fraud analysts, supervisors, and trial counsels. The main reason for such an expansion is to provide further protection for investors. Gensler commented at the time By nearly doubling the size of this key unit, the SEC will be better equipped to police wrongdoing in the crypto markets while continuing to identify disclosure and controls issues with respect to cybersecurity. The agency emphasized that this division has resolved over 80 enforcement cases involving fraudulent cryptocurrency activities up to date. Those scams skimmed more than 2 billion from investors.

Getting your audio player ready... Mike Novogratz  billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital  has issued a statement addressing the recent meltdown of the Terra ecosystem. He highlights lessons hes learned from the situation but reinforces his faith in the crypto economy as a whole. The Idea That Failed In a letter to shareholders and the crypto community, Novogratz lamented the loss of over 40 billion in wealth suffered by LUNA and UST investors alike. The UST stabilization mechanism meant to maintain its dollar peg only ended up devaluing LUNA into worthlessness. UST was an attempt at creating an algorithmic stable coin that would live in a digital world, wrote Novogratz. It was a big idea that failed. Not only has the collapse dented confidence in crypto and DeFi, but it also burned part of Galaxy Digitals own balance sheet. The company bought LUNA in March of 2020 citing significant growth potential, as one of South Koreas top finance apps was already built upon Terra. However, Novogratz claims that the Federal Reserves tightening in the face of record-high inflation has caused the crypto market to unwind. This, he claims, placed immense price pressure on LUNA  the reserve asset backing UST, ultimately ending in a bank-run style death spiral for the coin. While the investor does not believe the bearish macroeconomic backdrop will end anytime soon, he remains confident in the crypto ecosystem. That said, he re-stressed some core tenets of crypto investing to stay cautious, including diversification and risk management. Many in the online community awaited Novogratzs commentary on the matter, who famously had a LUNA-themed tattoo emblazoned on his arm in January. My tattoo will be a constant reminder that venture investing requires humility, he said. Novogratz clarified that his companys treasury does not utilize algorithmic stablecoins. Re-Examining Terras Collapse Most top figures within the Terra ecosystem agree with Novogratz that the network unwound due to its flawed UST stabilization mechanism. However, many also theorize that UST was initially de-pegged because of a deliberate short attack, executed by a handful of wealthy actors. A post retweeted by Terra co-founder Do Kwon claims that nearly 300 million UST were dumped on Curve finance prior to its destabilization. This was followed by numerous shorts on LUNA, and Twitter posts echoing negative sentiment about the cryptocurrency.

They can improve their game theory, they can improve their risk assessment, but I think there will still always be some states of the world that they wont have thought of, pointed out Coppola in a discussion with Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg. Terras UST stablecoin, which relied on an algorithm to maintain a peg to the U.S. dollar, collapsed last week, sparking turmoil in the crypto markets. According to McGlone, Terras collapse is part of a natural purge of the crypto space that happens in every bear market. According to the analyst, the concerns around leading stablecoin Tether USDT, which briefly lost its peg to the dollar as a result of Terras collapse, shouldnt be overestimated. As McGlone pointed out, Tether already depegged briefly in April 2019 when the New York state attorney general filed a lawsuit against its sister company, Bitfinex. The market said, We dont care. This is a better way to transact dollars, said McGlone. Coppola, on the other hand, pointed out that while investors were redeeming Tether en mass amid Terras collapse, other stablecoins such as USD Coin USDC and Binance USD BUSD performed as safe-haven assets, thus proving to be more trusted. Still, Coppola thinks Tether is unlikely to suffer a collapse similar to the one experienced by Terra, as it is backed by real assets held in its reserves. She pointed out that in the event of a crisis, Tether would be able to avoid a mass bank run by suspending redemptions according to its policy. According to Coppola, the primary source of systemic risk for the crypto market is not stablecoins but crypto exchanges. In the event of a Coinbase failure, a lot of people are potentially going to lose a lot of money, she said. It would cause kind of a Lehman moment, if you like, in the crypto space.

Getting your audio player ready... In the aftermath of Terras collapse, co-founder Do Kwon now faces legal pressure from affected Korean investors. Theyve filed both criminal and civil lawsuits, alongside an order to seize Kwons assets. Trouble With the Law According to the Korean news outlet Munhwa, investors in both UST and LUNA filed with the court to seize Kwons property this week, while also suing for fraud. Theyll be represented by the legal firm RKB  Partners, from which 6 lawyers are already reviewing a complaint against the CEO. There are related investors inside the law firm, and we plan to file a complaint against CEO Kwon at the Financial Investigation Unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, said Kim Hyeon-kwon, a partner at LKB  Partners. Kwon became a target of the crypto industrys ire after the UST stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar. Its stabilization mechanism also caused Terras governance token LUNA to undergo hyperinflation, reducing its value to virtually zero. Many large investors in the protocol  such as the UK Youtuber KSI  watched their multi-million dollar LUNA positions crumble to nothing in the aftermath. As a result, Kwon may be summoned to appear before the South Korean government to testify on each cryptocurrencys collapse. The national politician Yun Chang-Hyun has requested that Kwon and other executives of local crypto exchanges explain their actions while the de-peg was taking place. Thats not all. Next week, a new Korean group called Victims of Luna, UST coins will file a lawsuit against both co-founder Do Kwon and Shin Hyun-Seong for fraud and illegal fundraising. Over 1500 people are members of the group. Neither lawsuit has reached court yet, but likely will soon. The Vote to Recreate Terra Do Kwon put forth a proposal on Monday suggesting that the Terra network fork from its current chain, and start again with a different cryptocurrency. As of Wednesday, the vote has gone live. About 20 of the votes are in so far, with 90 of respondents voting yes. Should it take place, the old devalued LUNA tokens will become LUNC aka LUNA Classic and the new LUNA supply will start at 1 billion tokens. Not everyone is satisfied with the idea, however. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated on Saturday that forking the chain wont work. Forking does not give the new fork any value, he said. Thats wishful thinking.

Getting your audio player ready... François Villeroy de Galhau  Governor of the Bank of France  reportedly said that Terras fiasco and the recent crash of the crypto market should serve as a wake-up call for implementing rules in the sector. As such, discussing such measures could be one of the main topics during this weeks meeting of Group of Seven G7 members. The recent events in Terras ecosystem have caught the eye of the G7 members. According to Reuters, the worlds leading economies Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the USA, and the EU might consider imposing a regulatory framework on the crypto industry during their meeting 18-20 May in Germany. The head of the French central bank  François Villeroy de Galhau  said these events are a wake-up call for the industry and that setting rules is a must now What happened in the recent past is a wake-up call for the urgent need for global regulation. Europe paved the way with MiCA regulatory framework for crypto assets, we will probably discuss these issues among many others at the G7 meeting in Germany this week. The EUs Markets on Crypto Assets MiCA is a proposed regulation that focuses on digital assets and their employment in the financial system. Earlier this year, the Union stated that MiCAs draft bill does not include the prohibition of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. This is not the first time François Villeroy de Galhau has urged for the implementation of rules in the sector. Last year, he warned that Europes monetary sovereignty is at risk if the EU authorities do not regulate cryptocurrencies. In his view, the Unions national currency could also be endangered if measures are not taken soon Whether it is digital currencies or payments, we in Europe must be ready to act as quickly as necessary or take the risk of an erosion of our monetary sovereignty. I must stress here the urgency we do not have much time left, one or two years.

The pair had come unstuck as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered economic policy insights during the Wall Street Journals Future of Everything Festival. I dont know if financial conditions have tightened more than this in a very long time, he told the papers chief economics correspondent, Nick Timiraos, in an interview. Powell appeared to confirm that 50-basis-point key interest rate hikes would continue in subsequent meetings of the Feds Federal Open Markets Committee FOMC and could reach neutral levels in Q4. Hikes afterward, however, could nonetheless continue if necessary to tame inflation further. With traditional markets already pricing in such a scenario, volatility overall was limited as Powell avoided surprises. BTCUSD saw a brief drop to 29,500 before recovering during Powells words.

Getting your audio player ready... Do Kwon, perhaps the most notorious name in the cryptocurrency industry in the past few weeks, might have to appear in front of the South Korean government in a hearing on the UST crash. According to the local report, Yun Chang-hyun, a rep from the nations ruling People Power Party, has requested a parliamentary hearing on everything that transpired with TerraUSD UST, its collapse, and the actions undertaken by some of the largest local crypto exchanges. As previously summarized, the Terra drama began when UST, the projects algorithmic stablecoin supposed to be pegged 11 with the USD, lost parity against the greenback. The tokens value plummeted to a low of 0.04 in the following week or so. The other native token  Luna  also slumped in value because users were able to profit by arbitraging it against UST. The South Korean politician outlined the damage this deterioration caused to local investors and wanted Do Kwon to appear in front of the countrys parliament. At the same time, Kwon is trying to find a solution, with his latest proposal being a hard fork. However, Chang-hyun also touched upon the role that the nations largest crypto exchanges played, asserting that Coinone and Korbit halted UST trading on May 10, Bithumb on May 11, but Upbit didnt follow suit for two more days. Consequently, he wants executives from these exchanges to appear in the hearing as well.

Getting your audio player ready... The Luna Foundation Guard LFG finally broke the silence and revealed exactly how much they spent to defend the UST peg throughout the events of last week. As CryptoPotato reported, UST  the algorithmic stablecoin of its ecosystem  lost its peg and came crashing last week. Because of how the protocol was designed, losing the peg meant that traders could redeem UST for LUNA in a massive arbitrage that saw the printing of over 6 trillion LUNA, causing its price to go to 0 in a few days. Its important to note that LFG had previously acquired a number of cryptocurrencies to be used in emergency situations like these. Unfortunately, it was for not  as the entire ecosystem came crashing by. Today, LFG revealed exactly how much of their reserves were sold in a bid to defend the UST peg. Prior to the events of last week, their reserves consisted of 80,394 BTC, 39,914 BNB, 26,281,671 USDT, 23,555,590 USDC, 1,973,554 AVAX, 497,344 UST, 1,691,261 LUNA. Consistent with its non-profit mission  focus on the health of the Terra ecosystem, beginning on May 9, when the price of UST began to drop substantially below one dollar, the Foundation began converting this reserve to UST. Per the tweet, LFG did so by using on-chain swaps while also transferring BTC to a counterparty to enable them to enter trades with the Foundation in large size and on short notice. LFG directly sold 26,281,671 USDT, 23,555,590 USDC, transferred 52,189 BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate of 1,515,689,462 UST. That said, LFG has yet to post any transaction sheets indicating that the money was spent to defend the peg.

Getting your audio player ready... The CEO of the worlds leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao CZ, said that he expects more transparency from Lunas team following last weeks UST-LUNA fiasco. Last week saw a top cryptocurrency literally go to zero in a matter of days. UST  Terras algorithmic stablecoin  lost its peg and crashed to some 0.225. Because of how the protocol works, this created a massive arbitrage opportunity as users could burn 1 UST and receive 1 worth of LUNA. So long as UST was below its peg, traders were able to print LUNA and dump it on the open market in a loop that saw a whopping 6.5 trillion enter circulation in a couple of days. Naturally, this crashed the price of LUNA to literally 0 as most of the exchanges delisted the asset. One of these exchanges was Binance. Now, CZ took it to Twitter to clarify his position on the matter. 18 These past weeks have proven to be a watershed moment for the crypto industry. We have witnessed the rapid decline of a major project, which sent ripples across the industry, but also a new found resiliency in the market that did not exist during the last market downswing.  CZ  Binance cz_binance May 15, 2022 CZ said that Binance didnt participate in the second round of funding for Luna, and they didnt acquire any UST. Binance Labs  the companys investment arm  backed Terra with 3 million back in 2018 before UST was even a thing. He also clarified that the last few days, we tried hard to support the Terra community. in My tweets, I am simply pointing out the potential issues from my understanding. In this regard, I would like to see more transparency from them read Luna team. Much more! Including specific on-chain transactions of all the funds.

Getting your audio player ready... In the aftermath of Terra LUNAs price collapse, multiple crypto exchanges have begun preventing users from buying or selling the token. However, Crypto.com has taken measures a step further, opting to reverse LUNA trades taking place in a certain time frame on May 12th. In an important update on Friday, CryptoCom claimed that users who traded LUNA in the hour from 1240  1339 UTC were quoted an incorrect price. Trading of the token was halted after the exchange detected the error, and remains frozen at the time of writing. However, the exchange has also stated that all LUNA buys and sells within that hour will be reversed, and affected users will be notified by email. Affected users will be credited USD 10 in CRO for the inconvenience caused, reads the statement. Binance  the worlds largest crypto exchange  has also halted both futures and spot trading for LUNA, as has the Canadian exchange Coinberry. The cryptocurrencys value has collapsed to less than that of a satoshi  the smallest unit of a Bitcoin  within a week. This is due to TerraUSD UST losing its intended peg to the dollar, causing many holders to redeem their holdings for LUNA all at once. LUNAs supply has now hyperinflated, rising from an estimated 3.45 billion yesterday to a whopping 6.5 trillion as of today. Terraform Labs were even forced to temporarily freeze the Terra blockchain yesterday, which would have prevented holders from withdrawing their LUNA holdings to a non-custodial wallet.

Getting your audio player ready... Popular British YouTuber and rapper JJ Olatunji, commonly known as KSI, recently revealed that he has lost over 2.8 million in LUNA following the cryptocurrencys freefall over the past few days. LUNA, the native token of the Terra ecosystem, was designed to help maintain the 1 peg of Terras algorithmic stablecoin, UST. But when the stablecoin depegged on May 9 and slipped below 40 cents, the effect was catastrophic for LUNA. The cryptocurrency all of its value, crashing from 62 on May 9 to essentially zero at the time of writing. KSIs 2.8 Million LUNA Investment Turns to Zero On Tuesday, when LUNA was still trading between 25 and 30, KSI revealed that he bought in on the dip and intended to hold it for a long time with the hope that the cryptocurrency would recover in a few years. He said he purchased 100,000 LUNA, worth around 2.9 million at the time. However, less than 48 hours later, the rapper tweeted that he had lost nearly all his investment. The total value of his LUNA position had tumbled to a little over 1,000 within two days. My 2.8 million dollars is literally worth 1000 HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Yeah Im packing this in  pic.twitter.comqeiVN5yG2w  KSICRYPTO ksicrypto May 12, 2022 At the time of this writing, however, his investment is virtually worthless. Moments of Revelation After recounting his losses, the rapper seemed rather optimistic. He shared a series of self-reflecting tweets, stating that he was grateful to have lost just a huge chunk of money and nothing else. KSI revealed that he had been solely focused on making tons of money before crypto became as popular as it is today. He realized that in his pursuit of money, he had neglected and somewhat destroyed the things that mattered the most  his family, friends, legacy, and health. He then mentioned that he was finally at peace with himself after accepting that he had lost money but nothing else. However now im finally at peace with myself. I just put 2.8 million in that Luna buy and its worth less than 50k. But thats ok because Im not dead.

A day later, LUNA validators made the decision to take the network offline as the volatility of the LUNAUST pair provided the potential for further governance attacks.

Getting your audio player ready... The worlds largest crypto exchange suspended LUNA and UST spot trading shortly after doing so to the LUNA coin-margined perpetual contracts. The companys CEO took it to Twitter to offer his view on the matter. CryptoPotato explained the saga that transpired with Terra and its two native cryptocurrencies  LUNA and UST. The latter, being an algorithmic stablecoin, essentially allowed users to profit by arbitraging it against LUNA ever since it started to de-peg from the USD that is supposed to be pegged 11 with. This ultimately led to a massive increase in LUNAs supply, which skyrocketed to over 6.5 trillion as of now from 350 million on May 9. Changpeng Zhao outlined these flaws in the design of the Terra protocol in his Twitter thread and touched upon the projects decision to halt the blockchain twice in the past 24 hours. These actions propelled Binance and other platforms to suspend trading as there were no deposits or withdrawals possible to or from any exchange. He believes some investors began accumulating portions of LUNA, whose price had tumbled from above 80 to well under the 2018 ICO price of 0.8, because they didnt understand that as soon as deposits are allowed, the price will likely crash further. It actually did dump even more another 99.9 to 0.000035 as of now. Despite a few speculations and proposals, TerraForm Labs and the LUNA Foundation Guard are yet to publish a specific solution to this mayhem. As such, CZ said he was very disappointed with how the team handled or not handled the situation. 5. I am very disappointed with how this USTLUNA incident was handled or not handled by the Terra team. We requested their team to restore the network, burn the extra minted LUNA, and recover the UST peg.

At the time of writing, LUNAUSD traded at an almost imperceptible average of 0.00005474 at the time of writin, according to data from CoinMarketCap. To the dismay of those hoping to long at previously already low levels, LUNA could not stop its decline, and the latest measures by Terra appear to have exacerbated the situation. Supply increases, which began in earnest on May 8, took a turn for the nonsensical in recent days in a move reminiscent of hyperinflationary fiat currencies. On May 11, 1.8 billion LUNA was minted and added to the existing 764 million supply. If that were not enough, May 12 saw 185 billion more tokens appear. Finally, on May 13, Terra minted 6.7 trillion LUNA  an increase of 3,483 at once.

Getting your audio player ready... The force of the bear market has hit some projects worse than others. But no coin has gone through more pain than LUNA, the governance token behind the Terra ecosystem. The token has fallen so much, so fast that Binance the worlds largest crypto exchange is turning its back against it. On May 12, Binance announced the suspension of perpetual contracts on the LUNAUSDT pair after lowering the authorized leverage to 8x. This move comes after a series of events that caused the price of LUNA to plummet by more than 99, inflicting millions of dollars in losses to investors in the crypto community. As mentioned previously, Binance Futures will conduct an automatic settlement on the LUNA USDT-Margined Contract and then delist the Futures contract at May 12, 2022 330pm UTC.httpst.co774JF0HcqP  Binance binance May 12, 2022 However, that was not enough. LUNA kept falling with no signs of stopping. Just hours after the previous announcement, Binance said it would be removing cross and isolated margin pairs, spot trading pairs BUSD margined perpetual contracts on LUNA, basically saying goodbye to the so hyped cryptocurrency. Image Binance This move is not spontaneus. One day before, on May 11, Binance reduced the maximum leverage on LUNA futures to 8X after seeing a massive wave of liquidations due to overleveraged positions. However, anyone trying to save a long leveraged position during that day would have lost it, as the LUNA token is currently trading at less than 0.005. Yesterday, the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao warned via his official Twitter account that it was necessary to respect the market when trading it since it is a new market with new stablecoins, that When they are hot, they are all the rage. But When they drop, it can be a vicious circle. This message was related to all that was happening with UST. Many asked me about the markets today. We need to respect the market, with a level of caution too. It goes up and down in cycles. And especially the fact that it doesnt always make sense. 14  CZ  Binance cz_binance May 11, 2022 LUNA price collapses and drives several people out of business On May 11, the price of LUNA fell from 40 to less than 1. Such was the case that there were even people in the Reddit community who spoke of suicide, while others reported losing their savings and house mortgages due to the crash. Top post on Terras Reddit forum. Image Reddit In less than a week, anyone with 100,000 invested in Terras project went down to just under 500 in total assets. And this is not counting those who froze their money in the safe UST stablecoin. Even though UST was designed to be worth 1, the token crashed from 1 to 0.2 which is catastrophic for any investor, conservative or aggressive.

Yeah Im packing this in  pic.twitter.comqeiVN5yG2w  KSICRYPTO ksicrypto May 12, 2022 For now, the team behind Terra LUNA announced that they are working on specific measures to bring the project back to life however, so far, the actions taken seem not to have impacted the broader market sentiment. Validators are applying a patch to disable further delegations, and they will coordinate to restart the network in a few minutes. httpst.co4gakxPLpLm  Terra UST  Powered by LUNA  terra_money May 12, 2022 The team behind Terra is now considering all proposals to resuscitate LUNA and UST even ones that would have been unthinkable before, like altering the tokens algorithm. Today the Terra development team announced that they had stopped the blockchain to avoid governance attacks after a severe inflation of LUNA. Therefore, although Terra founder Do Kwon said on May 11 that they are working to bring the project back, other exchanges may follow in Binances footsteps and end up delisting LUNAUSDT trading until further notice.

Getting your audio player ready... Terra validators have reportedly decided to freeze Terras blockchain due to LUNAs collapsing market price. The team argues that at such low costs, a whale buyer could easily commit a governance attack on the network. The chain was officially frozen at block 7,603,700, making native transactions on Terras blockchain impossible. Terra LUNA, which has seen a price collapse of over 99 within the past week, also serves as the protocols governance token. Governance tokens let holders submit and vote upon the governance proposals related to upgrading a blockchain protocol. However, if one gains control of over 50 of a governance tokens supply, he could theoretically alter the protocol in a malicious way. Fortress protocol was struck by such an attack last week when a hacker effectively bought out its governance for under 20,000. Today, LUNA has a circulating supply of roughly 3.45 billion. Trading at only a penny, half of the supply would cost just a few hundred million dollars shared between a few wealthy collaborators. Terras collapse is largely due to the destabilization of USTs peg to the dollar, which led to conversions of UST for LUNA en masse. The coins price is now less than it was during its ICO, meaning early investors are now underwater if they held their positions. Amid broader stablecoin panic, even Tether began to lose its peg earlier today, though not to the same degree as UST.

Getting your audio player ready... New York-based cryptocurrency custody and exchange Gemini has refuted allegations about its involvement in the massive selloff of Terras native cryptocurrency, LUNA. Gemini Says Not Involved in LUNAs Price Decline Gemini, via its official Twitter handle, has denied earlier rumors that the company contributed to LUNAs price plunge after loaning 100,000 bitcoin worth 2.8 billion at the time of writing to investment company giants BlackRock and Citadel. The crypto exchanges tweet said We are aware of a recent story that suggested Gemini made a 100K BTC loan to large institutional counter-parties that reportedly resulted in a selloff in LUNA. Gemini made no such loan. Earlier rumors stated that BlackRock and Citadel jointly borrowed 100,000 BTC from Gemini. Both companies allegedly swapped 25,000 BTC for UST, an algorithmic stablecoin that has lost its peg, only to dump later both assets, which supposedly triggered LUNAs massive selloff and further broke USTs 1 peg. BlackRock and Citadel have also dispelled the rumors, according to a Forbes report. A Citadel source said that the company is not involved in any stablecoin trading, including UST. BlackRock, like Citadel, also noted that the firm did not trade UST. LUNA is currently down over 99, with the price hovering around 0.30, according to CoinGecko. UST stablecoin, which is yet to regain dollar parity, is at 0.6. Meanwhile, Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, recently proposed a plan to restore USTs peg. According to the executive, the way forward would be to absorb the stablecoin supply that wants to exit before UST can start to repeg. Kwon also noted that Terra endorsed community proposal 1164, which suggests an increase in LUNAs minting capacity from 293 million to around 1.2 billion. The Terraform Lab chief added that as UST is being rebuilt, the team will adjust the stablecoins mechanism to be collateralized. Major South Korean Exchanges Place LUNA on Warning List In the wake of LUNAs price crash, South Korean exchanges have issued warnings about the crypto token. Upbit deemed LUNA a cautionary item, while Bithumb designated the asset as an investment warning item to protect investors. The designation was issued because of the tokens high price fluctuations. Bithumb noted that the warning did not mean that LUNA was suspended but said that the exchange could decide to halt trading of the token or not after the designation warning has elapsed.

As the algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its dollar peg, crashing to a low of around 0.30, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon took to Twitter to share his rescue plan. At the same time, the value of sister token LUNA, once a top-10 crypto project by market capitalization, plunged over 98 to 0.84, according to CoinMarketCap. For reference LUNA was trading north of 120 in early April.Amid the chaos, Cointelegraph analysts Sam Bourgi, Jordan Finneseth, Marcel Pechman and Benton Yaun held an emergency edition of The Market Report, which normally airs on Tuesdays, to discuss what exactly went down. Bourgi explained the theoretical underpinnings of algorithmic stablecoins and why theyre inherently risky before dissecting how UST lost its peg. Remember all that excitement surrounding Luna Foundation Guards Bitcoin BTC purchases? That was one of the biggest red flags, Bourgi said. Finneseth broke down the market psychology of market crashes and why investors can expect more pain in the months ahead. Yaun, meanwhile, discussed some potential theories as to who may have been responsible for orchestrating the BTC dump that triggered the panic inside Terras ecosystem.

Economist Frances Coppola concurred that the UST debacle was an attack. Ran NeuNer, host of CNBCs Crypto Trader and a good friend of Kwon, sent the rumor mill into hyperdrive with his suggestion that American market maker Citadel could be behind the attack. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK, also said the word on the street is that it may be Citadel. While billionaire Citadel Securities founder Ken Griffin has laid bare his dislike for the crypto industry comparing the trillion-dollar market to abstract art  the suggestion that Citadel would attack UST remains speculation. Inevitably, Crypto Twitter accused Neuner of trying to protect his significant yet fast-evaporating LUNA bags. Speculation that the attack on UST was a coordinate attack by Citadel. This seems highly plausible given their anti- Bitcoin stance. Also, when stablekwonLFG publicized they would protect the peg at certain level it was an invitation to attack. Wall Street are experts at this. Ran NeuNer cryptomanran May 10, 2022 Meanwhile, Larry Cermack, a crypto researcher, suggested that over 1 billion is inbound to shore up and fight the Luna Foundation Guard wildfire. According to Cermack, venture capital would be provided by Celsius, Jump and Alameda, among others. Theories aside, for many crypto observers, researchers and believers, the UST car crash was a foreseeable and b one of the most significant crypto deaths in history.

Getting your audio player ready... After a dramatic 90 market crash, LUNA, trading below 5, is now deemed a cautionary item by the popular South Korean cryptocurrency exchange UpBit. Investors are unnerved after the embattled crypto project  Terras flagship stablecoin UST  lost its peg with the US Dollar. Additionally, Bithumb also issued a warning to its investors while dealing with LUNA. In a bid to protect clients, the exchange designated the cryptocurrency as an Investment Warning Item. LUNAs Fate Hangs in Limbo According to the crypto analytic platform, IntoTheBlock, the number of transactions reached a new high, representing a massive 13x increase against the previous two days as investors continue to rush to sell their UST positions. What does this mean for LUNA? André Nakano de Melo, the CEO of TITANDAO, highlighted the current problem with UST and LUNA, which is that traders want to get both the tokens out of the exchanges so they can exploit the arbitrage opportunity by redeeming UST for LUNA. He also went on to add that exchanges need to stop the outflows as they might not have enough tokens UST and LUNA for all traders that want to withdraw. While speaking with CryptoPotato, the CEO said, The cold storage of tokens on exchanges does not imply they actually have all tokens for redemption. It is like a bank we see a digit in our bank account, but if everyone decides to go and withdraw the money on the same day like in a bank run, the bank cannot provide all the physical cash needed. Is LUNA Following the Destructive Path of IRON? Terras debacle mirrors that of TITAN last summer when a token backing up the stablecoin IRON, called TITAN, dropped to zero as uncertainty choked the market. It went on to be known as the worlds first large-scale crypto bank run. Investors rushed to redeem IRON quickly after the peg of IRON to USDC broke. This triggered a death spiral in TITANs price, which was used as collateral to mint the stablecoin. The collateral damage on LUNA for USTs significant deviation was epic. According to Melo, LUNA is following a similar death spiral as TITAN. He said, UST was trading at close to 0.2 today, so confidence will be hard to regain. I do believe LUNA will eventually go even further down as IRON stablecoin was backed by 0.75 USDC while UST is only backed by LUNA. There is not too big to fail in crypto. At times of market stress such as this, it remains to be seen if LUNA manages to prove its viability.

Getting your audio player ready... The outspoken Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon finally broke his silence and detailed the new rescue plan he has to re-peg the ecosystems flagship stablecoin, UST. In the latest Twitter thread, Kwon said that the only path forward is to absorb the stablecoin supply that intends to exit before UST can start to re-peg. The exec added that there is no other way out after accepting the community proposal. He further explained, The price stabilization mechanism is absorbing UST supply over 10 of total supply, but the cost of absorbing so much stablecoins at the same time has stretched out the on-chain swap spread to 40, and Luna price has diminished dramatically absorbing the arbs. The main idea is to focus on the arbitrage opportunity. The proposal stated that allowing more efficient UST to burn and LUNA mint will put pressure on the latters price in the short term. But this mechanism will be an effective way to bring UST back from deviating to its intended peg and will eventually stabilize LUNAs price. The burning of billions of UST will trigger a significant dilution of LUNA. It further added, Nevertheless, there is no limit in LUNA supply, this market mechanism will actually work to bring stable UST and stable LUNA price although likely at a lower price point for LUNA. The devs will essentially increase the base pool from 50 million to 100 million special drawing rights SDR and decrease PoolRecoveryBlock from 36 to 18. This, in turn, will ramp up minting capacity from 293 million to nearly 1.2 billion, thereby minting 4x of the stablecoin than usual. As the team starts to rebuild UST, Kwon said that the team will adjust its mechanism to be collateralized, meaning UST will be backed by other financial assets, including traditional and cryptocurrencies. Despite publishing this proposal several hours ago, it has failed to bring any trust back. LUNA plummeted below 1 earlier today, losing around 99 of its value in less than a week.

Getting your audio player ready... Terra continues to lead the market-wide correction as LUNA has plummeted below 1, meaning a weekly drop of almost 99. Bitcoin and the altcoins are also in the red, with the total liquidations exceeding 700 million on a daily scale. CryptoPotato reported earlier today that the cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets had lost over 400 billion in less than a week, dropping to a 10-month low of 1.350 trillion. The landscape has only worsened since then as BTC failed at 31,000 and started dumping once more. Minutes ago, the primary cryptocurrency charted its latest low since July 2021 of 29,000 on Bitstamp. As it typically happens, the altcoins are in no better shape. Just the opposite, Ethereum is down by 10 to below 2,200, BNB is beneath 300 -15, While Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, Dogecoin, and many others have lost over 20 on a daily scale. Yet, no other coin has suffered as much as Terras native cryptocurrency  LUNA. The saga that unfolded in the past week or so, leading to UST de-pegging from its supposed price of 1, meant that users could profit by arbitraging LUNA. Thus, the selling pressure propelled a massive price slump for LUNA, which dumped below 1 earlier today. Just for reference, the asset traded at 90 six days ago. This means it has lost about 99 of its value in less than a week. LUNAUSD.

Getting your audio player ready... With Terra getting in the news in the past several days for its failing stablecoin, Justin Sun reassured that the TRON DAO Reserve plans to allocate 2 billion to fight potential attacks against TRX, which seems to be the next target after LUNA. In the past week or so, all eyes in and outside the crypto community have been on Terra and its two native cryptocurrencies  LUNA and UST. As CryptoPotato summarized earlier, UST, a stablecoin supposed to be pegged 11 with the USD, lost that peg, and its price dumped to a low of 0.2 on Binance. Since its an algorithmic stablecoin with new tokens issued when users burn LUNA and vice-versa, this massive crash allowed speculators to capitalize on the situation by arbitraging. This led to a mind-blowing price drop for LUNA, which as of writing these lines, trades at 1.15. This means that the token has lost roughly 98 of its value in less than a week. Due to some similarities in how the stablecoins of Terra and TRON work both being algorithmic, Justin Sun warned that his project could be the next target of similar attacks. He took it to Twitter to outline the potential threat, saying that the funding rate of shorting TRX on Binance has exceeded 100 APR, later updating that the percentage has gone to nearly 400. However, Sun reassured that the TRON DAO Reserve plans to deploy 2 billion to fight against something similar happening to his project as it did with Terra. Sun also noted that USDD unlike UST has remained very stable amid the latest market volatility. Additionally, he said USDD has a total market cap of 271 million, while the TRON DAO Reserve holds 10 billion. USDD remains very stable in todays market volatility. Current the total cap of USDD is 271 million and total reserve in trondaoreserve is 10 billion. pic.twitter.comc9wwbBGsJx  H.E.

Author Chayanika Deka Last Updated May 11, 2022  0751 Months of price appreciation were wiped out in a matter of a few days. LUNA is down by more than 95 in less than a week. Does that mean Do Kwon will lose his million-dollar bet? Getting your audio player ready... As Terra ecosystems UST stablecoin untethered over the weekend, LUNA slipped frantically as well, losing approximately 95 of its value. The efforts to rescue UST continue as LFG  the entity that acts as a resolve protocol  emptied its treasury wallet of all its Bitcoin. Rumors are now circling that the organization wants to raise 1 billion to aid its freefalling project. But what about the multi-million dollar bet Do Kwon made recently? LUNA Meltdown LUNA, which depends on TerraUSD, dived from 87 to the press price of 4.5 in less than a week. This may not be the best time to recall the bet placed by the outspoken founder of Terraforms Labs, Do Kwon. Nearly two months ago, Kwon agreed to a 1 million bet against a community member  Sensei Algod whether LUNAs price would be higher in a year, meaning  above 88. The founder later said yes to yet another wager by pseudonymous crypto trader GCR, only this time, the stakes were 10x higher. Soon, Kwon transferred 10 million worth of stablecoins to be held in escrow pending the outcome of the bet. Following the latest turn of events, Sensei Algod said that even if the peg restores, the trust is still lost while questioning whether LUNA will ever recover from the crash. GCR, on the other hand, had proposed 50 million and 20 million bets shortly after the first one, but Kwon did not respond. Now, the user has updated the original bet  shorting LUNA for 10 million. Cryptocurrency researcher, Hasu, who previously warned that undercollateralized stablecoins cannot work, said that as a stablecoin issuer, the moral choice will be to defend UST by holding the treasury, even if it means LUNA going to zero. Despite the current bearish outlook, many believe that LUNA will spring back up. One such is the host of CNBCs Crypto Trader, Ran Neuner, who tweeted, Every attack makes LUNA more resilient. It happened to BITCOIN many times in the early days. Its part of the process! May Day While algorithmic stablecoin has gained significant steam, it has also managed to draw attention among critics. Many belonging to the latter cohort believe that the problems with assets such as UST are obvious. Primarily, the reasons are two  its not backed by a reserve, and specialized algorithms cannot always guarantee that the market works. Last year, billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner and investor on ABCs Shark Tank, Mark Cuban, said he lost money when the algorithmic stablecoin IRON after it de-pegged from the US dollar following a major selloff by large investors. Kwon, however, is undeterred by these narratives. Recent market conditions have put immense pressure on the TerraUSD peg. And what many feared eventually transpired. Not one but two major de-pegging events. Critics noted that Terras contingency measures could add to the current sell pressure in the market and push the price further down. However, Kwon shared the founding partner at Delphi Ventures, Jose Macedos tweet that says, LFG made UST more robust, but also temporarily more centralized.

Getting your audio player ready... Terra LUNAs price collapse from Monday continues, now tracing down beneath 16 per coin. Meanwhile, the networks dollar-pegged stablecoin TerraUSD UST continues trading at just 0.8, far below its intended 1.00 value peg. LUNA trades at just 15.84 at the time of writing, down 63.13 in the past 24 hours, and 80.74 over the week. The cryptocurrency doubly serves as a governance token for the Terra blockchain, and the reserve asset made to preserve the stability of its various stablecoins. The most popular stablecoin  TerraUSD  began drifting off of its dollar peg on Sunday, as noted by the Luna Foundation Guard LFG. To fix the problem, the organization tried deploying some of its Bitcoin reserves on the market to prop up USTs price. However, these reserves have failed to save the stablecoin, and its value has deviated as low as 0.69. To make matters worse, its crushed value has created a massive arbitrage opportunity within the Terra ecosystem. As every UST is always convertible for about one dollar of LUNA, traders are incentivized to trade their stablecoins in, only to dump their LUNA on the market shortly after for a profit. This has likely contributed to the death spiral of LUNAs price, which has fallen substantially even next to other bleeding cryptos. By comparison, Bitcoin and Ethereum are down by just 18 and 17 this week respectively. Amid the chaos, Binance was forced to halt UST withdrawals from exchanges, citing network slowness and congestion. Janet Yellen  Treasury Secretary of the United States  even made mention of TerraUSDs de-pegging during a senate hearing today. She believes it illustrates how stablecoins pose risks to financial stability and need a regulatory framework. Terra is now the 20th largest crypto by market cap, despite being within the top 10 just days ago. Terra co-founder Do Kwon stated today that he will soon unveil a plan to recover USTs peg.

Getting your audio player ready... Binance has announced temporarily suspending LUNA and UST tokens on Tuesday, citing a high volume of pending withdrawal transactions as a result of network slowness and congestion. The latest move by the cryptocurrency exchange comes after LFG decided to lend 1.5 billion in BTC and UST to defend the latters peg. The company also said that it would resume withdrawals for the two tokens once it deems the network to be stable and the volume of pending withdrawals has reduced. In a statement, Terras official Twitter account asked users to be mindful while using public infrastructure. It said, If you are using the public infra, please do not spam it at this time as we are experiencing naturally high levels of transaction volume. Please be mindful of our public infra usage. More updates on todays events and future plans to follow. Other prominent platforms such as Kraken and CoinList have also halted withdrawals. FTX, on the other hand, is still processing UST withdrawals. As reported earlier by CryptoPotato, TerraUSD UST lost its peg with the dollar over the weekend. The third-largest stablecoin by total issuance fell as low as 0.68 before recovering to 0.91, according to data from CoinMarketCap. In a bid to defend its peg, the Luna Foundation Guard said that it will loan 1.5 billion in Bitcoin and UST to third-party platforms that plan to provide support for the algorithmic stablecoins peg. The address that previously contained over 70,000 BTC is currently completely depleted. Source Bitinfocharts Many critics believe that the move may have exacerbated a sell-off in the Bitcoin market that drove it to the lowest price since July 2021. Along with UST, LUNA lost a whopping 50 of its value in the past day alone and crashed to lows not seen since last October amidst macro volatile conditions in the wider cryptocurrency market. Several experts in the crypto sector were not happy about TFL Founder Do Kwons move to entwine the project with Bitcoin, which happens to be the very core of the digital asset market. The argument behind it is the fact that with algorithmic stablecoins, unlike traditional stablecoins, the price stability originates from the use of specialized algorithms and active treasury management that manage the supply of tokens in circulation. UPDATE Several hours after, Binance said it had reenabled withdrawals of UST and LUNA and promised to continue monitoring the situation.

Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTCUSDTBitcoin plummeted below the ascending channel on May 5 and has continued lower, indicating that bears are in no mood to let go of their advantage. The price has dipped below the critical support at 32,917 but the bears may face a strong challenge from the bulls at lower levels.BTCUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf the price rebounds off the current level, the relief rally could reach the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 37,670. This is an important level to watch out for because if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.The bears will then make another attempt to pull the BTCUSDT pair to the critical support at 28,805. This level is again likely to attract buying by the bulls.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will be the first indication that the selling pressure may be reducing. That could clear the path for a possible rally to the 50-day simple moving average SMA 41,279.ETHUSDTEther ETH broke below the uptrend line on May 7. This move invalidated the developing ascending triangle pattern. The breakdown of a bullish pattern is usually a bearish sign as stops of several bulls who may have purchased in anticipation of a breakout from the pattern being triggered.ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewStrong selling has pulled the price below the immediate support at 2,445. This opens the door for a possible drop to the critical support zone between 2,300 and 2,159. The bulls are likely to defend this zone with all their might because a break below it could sink the ETHUSDT pair to 1,700.If the price rebounds off the support zone, the bulls will make an attempt to push the pair above the 20-day EMA 2,790. If they succeed, it will suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA 3,043.BNBUSDTBNB has witnessed sustained selling for the past few days. The bears pulled the price below the strong support at 350 and are now challenging the critical level at 320.BNBUSDT daily chart.

There is a minor support at 300 but if this level fails to arrest the decline, the BNBUSDT pair could plummet to 250. Alternatively, if the price rebounds off 320, the bulls will try to push the pair above 350 and challenge the 20-day EMA 383. The buyers will have to clear this hurdle to signal that the decline could be over. The pair could then rise to the 50-day SMA 409.XRPUSDTRipple XRP turned down from the 20-day EMA 0.63 on May 5 and dipped below 0.62. The buyers attempted to push the price back above 0.62 on May 6 but the bears held their ground.XRPUSDT daily chart.

If they succeed, it will suggest that the selling pressure could be reducing.

The price continued its downward move and has slipped below the strong support at 75.SOLUSDT daily chart.

If the price rebounds off this zone, the buyers will try to push and sustain the pair back above 75. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the downtrend could be ending.On the contrary, if the recovery stalls at 75, it will suggest that bears have flipped the level into resistance. If that happens, the bears will attempt to resume the decline.ADAUSDT Cardano ADA rose above the 20-day EMA 0.81 on May 4 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The price turned down on May 5 and broke below the strong support at 0.74 on May 8.ADAUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThis suggests the resumption of the downtrend.

The sellers will then attempt to sink the pair to the psychological support at 0.50.LUNAUSDTTerras LUNA token turned down from the downtrend line on May 5 and plunged below the strong support at 75 on May 7. This completed the bearish head and shoulders pattern, suggesting the start of a new downtrend.LUNAUSDT daily chart.

The selling picked up momentum on May 9 and the bears have pulled the price below the strong support at 0.12.DOGEUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to sellers.

Rather, the goal is to strengthen the liquidity around the UST peg, he added. The Weekend De-peg It all started after UST witnessed high-volume withdrawals from Terras Anchor Protocol. It is important to note that UST deposits currently earn investors 18.8 APY. Anchors total UST deposits reduced from 14 billion to 11.2 billion as a result.

The exec also asserted that the market event did not appear to originate from the retail players. Terras Twitter handle claimed that a small percentage of whales accounted for the bulk of outflows. However, one example that caught attention was a freshly funded address that bridged 84 million of UST to Ethereum. According to Polygons Mudit Gupta, the address initiated bridging before Terraform Labs TFL removed liquidity. Massive quantities of UST were also withdrawn from liquidity pools on the prominent decentralized exchange, Curve as well. Do Kwon, however, confirmed that 150 million of UST were removed by TFL from Curve to prepare for the deployment into 4pool next week. The founder confirmed that the 84 million dump was not done by them.

As a comparison, Solana SOL and XRP futures contracts hold a 660 million open interest.LUNA fundamentals are still solidEven though it seems impossible to pinpoint the cause of LUNAs price drop, the decrease in the networks decentralized apps use can partially explain the movement. However, the increase in its smart contract deposits, as shown by the TVL increase and sound interest from derivatives traders, point to a price recovery in the near-term.The data suggests that Terra holders are not concerned about the 31 price correction and are more focused on the ecosystems growth versus its competitors. As long as these metrics remain healthy, investors are not likely to sell at a loss.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

That led to weekly outflows of 132.7 million from Bitcoin BTC funds last week, the largest since June of last year, according to a report from CoinShares. Could Bitcoin and altcoins enter a period of capitulation or will investors buy after the Fed event is over? Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical levels to watch out for both on the upside and the downside.BTCUSDTThe bulls have successfully defended the support line of the ascending channel for the past four days, which is a positive sign.

The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above this level to signal a change in the short-term trend. The pair could then rise to the 200-day SMA 3,441. A break and close above this level could indicate the start of a new uptrend.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are not willing to let go of their advantage. That could enhance the prospects of a break below the uptrend line. If that happens, the pair could plummet to 2,450.BNBUSDTBNB has been trading below the 391 support for the past four days but the bears could not build upon this advantage and sink the price to 350.

Bitcoin BTC plummeted 17 in April to record its worst-ever April performance. Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite plunged 13.3 in April, its worst monthly performance since October 2008. However, a major positive for crypto investors is that Bitcoin is still above its year-to-date low, near 33,000. In comparison, the Nasdaq 100 has hit a new low for 2022, while the SP 500 is just a whisker away from making a new year-to-date low. This suggests that Bitcoin has managed to avoid a major sell-off, indicating demand at lower levels.Crypto market data daily view.

Lets study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.BTCUSDTBitcoin slipped to the support line of the ascending channel on April 30 but the rebound off it on May 1 suggests that the bulls are defending the level with all their might.BTCUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewAlthough the downsloping 20-day exponential moving average EMA of 39,956 suggests an advantage to sellers, the positive divergence on the relative strength index RSI indicates that the negative momentum may be weakening.If the rebound sustains, the bulls will attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest accumulation near the support line. The pair could then rise to the 50-day simple moving average SMA of 41,954.On the contrary, a weak rebound will signal a lack of aggressive buying near the support line. If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA and breaks below the channel, the BTCTether USDT pair could drop to 34,322 and later retest the critical support at 32,917.BTCUSDT 4-hour chart. Source TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows that the price has been declining inside a falling wedge pattern. The RSI has formed a positive divergence, indicating that the bearish momentum may be weakening.If the price breaks above the resistance line of the wedge, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to 41,000. This level may again act as a resistance, but if bulls clear this hurdle, the next stop could be 43,000.Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below the wedge, the selling could pick up momentum.LUNAUSDTTerra LUNA has been consolidating in an uptrend for the past several days.

A break and close above the 50-SMA could indicate that the pair may remain range-bound between 100 and 75 for some time.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the current level or the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the bears are selling on every minor rally. That could result in a retest of the strong support at 75.NEARUSDTThe failure of the bulls to push Near Protocol NEAR above 18 resulted in a sharp decline in the past few days. The price slipped to the psychological support at 10 on April 30, but the strong rebound on May 1 indicates aggressive buying by the bulls.NEARUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf buyers thrust the price above the 200-day SMA of 11.94, it will suggest that the decline to 10 may have been a bear trap. The NEARUSDT pair could then rise to the 20-day EMA of 13.86, where the bears may again try to stall the recovery.The bulls will have to clear this hurdle to signal that the corrective phase may be over. That could start a rally toward the strong overhead resistance at 18.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 200-day SMA, the likelihood of a break below 10 increases.

Pantera Blockchain Fund, which had plans to raise 600 million, has amassed about 1.3 billion, indicating huge demand.Will bulls be able to sustain the bounce in Bitcoin and altcoins? Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTCUSDTAlthough Bitcoin broke below the psychological level at 40,000 on April 11, the bears could not build upon this momentum. This indicates that the bulls are buying at lower levels.BTCUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe relief rally could hit a wall at the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 42,967. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index RSI below 44 suggest a minor advantage to sellers. The bears will have to sink the price below 39,200 to resume the decline. The BTCUSDT pair could then drop to the support line of the ascending channel. On the contrary, if the price continues higher and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could challenge the overhead resistance at 45,400.ETHUSDTThe bulls are attempting to arrest the decline at the 50-day simple moving average SMA 2,958. Although Ether ETH attempted a rebound on April 12, the buyers could not sustain the higher levels.ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe bulls are again attempting to extend the relief rally on April 13. The bounce is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA 3,172. If the price turns down from this level, the likelihood of a break below the 50-day SMA increases. If that happens, the ETHUSDT pair could decline to the uptrend line.Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest aggressive buying by the bulls. The pair could then attempt a rally to the 200-day SMA 3,490. The pair may then consolidate between the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA for a few days.BNBUSDTBNB plunged below the 50-day SMA 402 on April 11 but the bears could not capitalize on this breakdown. The bulls purchased the dip aggressively and pushed the price back above the 50-day SMA on April 12.BNBUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe buyers are attempting to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA 420. If they succeed, the BNBUSDT pair could rally to the 200-day SMA 470 where the bears may mount a strong resistance. That could keep the price inside the range between the 200-day SMA and the 50-day SMA for a few days.Conversely, if the price fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate selling at higher levels. The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the price below the immediate support at 391. If they manage to do that, the pair could slide to 350.SOLUSDTSolana SOL bounced off the 50-day SMA 99 on April 12 but the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA 110. This suggests that bears are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA.SOLUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe bears will now attempt to sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the SOLUSDT pair could drop to the strong support at 81. The bulls are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break and close below it could resume the downtrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at 122.XRPUSDTRipple XRP bounced off the strong support at 0.69 on April 12 but the bulls could not sustain the recovery. This indicates that the bears are active at higher levels. The inside-day candlestick pattern on April 13 suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears.XRPUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe 20-day EMA 0.77 is sloping down and the RSI is near 39, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price breaks below the strong support at 0.69, the selling could pick up momentum. The XRPUSDT pair could then decline to 0.62.Conversely, if the price continues to move up, the pair will attempt to rise above the 50-day SMA 0.78. If that happens, it will suggest that the pair could trade inside a large range between 0.69 and 0.91 for some more time. ADAUSDT Cardano ADA attempted a relief rally on April 12 but the bulls could not clear the overhead hurdle at the psychological level at 1. This indicates that bears are attempting to flip the 1 level into resistance.ADAUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below 0.91, the correction could resume. The ADAUSDT pair could then drop to 0.86 and later to the critical support at 0.74. The 20-day EMA 1.04 is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, suggesting advantage to bears.This negative view will be invalidated in the short term if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA. Such a move could open the doors for a possible rally to the overhead resistance at 1.26.LUNAUSDTTerras LUNA token formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on April 12 but the long wick on the days candlestick suggests that bears sold at higher levels. A minor positive is that the buyers are again trying to extend the recovery on April 13.LUNAUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf bulls push the price above 89, the LUNAUSDT pair could rise to the 20-day EMA 96 where the bears are likely to mount a strong resistance. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone indicate advantage to sellers. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below 80, the correction could resume and the pair may slide to the strong support at 75. Alternatively, if the price continues to move up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level at 104.Related ApeCoin eyes 250 rally amid bull pennant breakout, Robinhood APE listing rumorsAVAXUSDTThe bulls are attempting to arrest the decline in Avalanche AVAX at the uptrend line but the bounce is likely to encounter strong resistance from the bears near the moving averages.AVAXUSDT daily chart.

If that happens, the AVAXUSDT pair could decline to the next support at 65.This level is likely to act as a strong support as the bulls have defended it successfully on two previous occasions. A strong rebound off it will indicate that the pair may trade inside the range between 65 and 99 for a few more days.Alternatively, a break and close below 65 could intensify selling and the pair may drop to the critical support at 51.DOTUSDTPolkadot DOT is attempting a recovery after the sharp fall on April 11, which suggests buying at lower levels. However, the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance from the bears at higher levels.DOTUSDT daily chart.

If they succeed, the decline could extend to 14. The downsloping 20-day EMA 19 and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.Alternatively, if the price moves up sharply and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair could then consolidate inside the range between 16 and 23 for a few more days.DOGEUSDTThe buyers are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA 0.13 but the weak rebound off the strong support suggests a lack of buyers in Dogecoin DOGE at higher levels. This increases the possibility of a break below the 50-day SMA.DOGEUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf the price fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA 0.14, the sellers will attempt to extend the decline by pulling the DOGEUSDT pair below the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair could drop to 0.12 and then slide to the critical support at 0.10.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up sharply and rises above 0.15, it will suggest strong buying at the 50-day SMA. The pair could then remain stuck between the 200-day SMA 0.18 and the 50-day SMA for a few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The overall drop tailed similar moves in the U.S. stock market last week after the Federal Reserve signaled its intentions to raise interest rates and shrink balance sheets sharply to curb rising inflation.Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX exchange, said Monday that Bitcoins correlation with tech stocks could have it run for 30,000 next. In other words, LUNAs high correlation with BTC so far this year puts it at risk of more downside if BTC doesnt rebound. The correlation between LUNA and BTC has been largely positive in 2022. Source TradingViewTale of two exposésLUNA picked additional downside cues from at least two exposé threads that went viral on Twitter over the weekend. The first thread, penned by a pseudonymous analyst DeFi_Made_Here on April 7, questioned LUNAs capability to maintain the peg of Terras native stablecoin, TerraUSD UST since it is not backed by any tangible asset. The second thread, published on April 9 by Jack Niewold, an analyst at the Crypto Pragmatist  a DeFi newsletter, accused Terra co-founder Do Kwon of receiving all the LUNA tokens meant to be burned to mint UST. He also alleged that the Luna Foundation Guard, a nonprofit organization that backs the Terra ecosystem, has been using a percentage of burned LUNA supply to buy Bitcoin.Kwon refuted the claims in a tweet-to-tweet response to Niewold, calling him a made up clickbait. The self-proclaimed master of stablecoin asserted that Terra burns LUNA 11 to mint new UST, which can be seen by testing a swap on the Anchor Protocol dashboard.Jose Maria Macedo, head of crypto research platform Delphi Digital, also rubbished Niewolds thread as absolutely terrible.Key LUNA price support breaksThe latest LUNA selloff also led its price below its key moving average support against the U.S. dollar.Related Bitcoin plumbs April lows as US dollar strength hits highest since May 2020In detail, the Terra token dropped below its 50-day exponential moving average 50-day EMA the red wave in the chart below, now near 90, almost two months after reclaiming it as support.

Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTCUSDTBitcoin plunged to the critical support at 42,594 on April 7 but a positive sign is that bulls held this level.

Source TradingViewThe moving averages have flattened out and the relative strength index RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.The bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 44,314 and the critical overhead resistance at 45,400. If they manage to do that, the BTCUSDT pair could challenge the 200-day simple moving average SMA 48,220.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA or 45,400, it will suggest that bears are selling on every rise. The bears will then try to pull the pair below the 50-day SMA 41,789. If they succeed, the decline could extend to the support line of the ascending channel.ETHUSDTEther ETH broke below the 20-day EMA 3,224 on April 6 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The bulls bought the dip and have pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA, indicating strong demand at lower levels.ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf buyers sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the ETHUSDT pair could again rise to the 200-day SMA 3,487.

The pair could then trade between these two moving averages for a few days.SOLUSDTThe bulls stalled the decline at the 20-day EMA 114 on April 6 but could not push Solana SOL back above the overhead resistance at 122.

Even Latin America, Asia Pacific, the United States and Europe witnessed over 40 more new users who started investing in 2021. Could Bitcoin and altcoins bounce off their support and extend the recovery? Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTCUSDTThe long wick on the candlestick of the past two days suggests that bears are selling near the 200-day simple moving average SMA 48,266. A minor positive has been that the bulls have not allowed Bitcoin to break below the important support at 45,400.BTCUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewHowever, this tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long. If the price breaks below the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 44,467, the BTCUSDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA 41,689. Such a move could invalidate the short-term bullish setup. Conversely, if the price rises from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders continue to buy on dips. That could enhance the prospects of a break above the 200-day SMA. If that happens, the pair could rally to 52,000.ETHUSDTEther ETH broke and closed above the 200-day SMA 3,487 on April 3 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears are trying to pull the price lower and trap the aggressive bulls.ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf the price breaks below 3,411, the bears will try to pull the ETHUSDT pair to the 20-day EMA 3,197. This is an important level for the bulls to defend if they want the positive momentum to remain intact.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the buyers will again try to thrust and sustain the price above the 200-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to 4,000.On the other hand, if the 20-day EMA support gives way, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA 2,895.BNBUSDTBNB has been trading close to the 445 level for the past few days. Although the bulls pushed the price above this level repeatedly, they could not sustain the higher levels and challenge the 200-day SMA 467. This indicates that demand dries up at higher levels.BNBUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe bears will now try to pull the price to the 20-day EMA 421, which is an important support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off this level, the buyers will make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle and push the BNBUSDT pair to 500.Alternatively, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term traders may be booking profits. That could pull the price to the 50-day SMA. A break below this support will suggest that the break above 445 may have been a bull trap.SOLUSDTSolanas SOL recovery stalled just below the 200-day SMA 150. This suggests that higher levels are attracting selling by the bears. The bears will now try to pull the price to the breakout level at 122.SOLUSDT daily chart.

The rising 20-day EMA 111 and the relative strength index RSI near the overbought zone indicate advantage to buyers.Contrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below 122, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. This is an important support to keep an eye on because a break below it could result in a decline to the 50-day SMA 96.XRPUSDTThe bulls attempted to push Ripple XRP above the overhead resistance at 0.86 but the bears did not budge. The failure to rise above 0.86 may attract profit-booking from short-term traders, which could sink the price to the 50-day SMA 0.78.XRPUSDT daily chart.

That could keep the XRPUSDT pair stuck between the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA 0.89 for a few days.The flattish 20-day EMA 0.82 and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a consolidation in the near term. If bears pull the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could plummet to 0.70. Alternatively, if buyers drive the price above the 200-day SMA, the pair could rally to the psychological level at 1.ADAUSDT Cardano ADA turned up on April 1 and has reached the overhead resistance at 1.26 where the bulls are likely to encounter strong resistance from the bears.ADAUSDT daily chart.

That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA 84. Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls continue to defend the level aggressively.

In fact, individuals associated with the ecosystem  both for and against  have placed massive bets in regard to where LUNA will be trading around this time next year. Pseudonymous crypto trader Sensei Algod is so bearish on Terras token that he recently wagered 1,000,000 that by March 14, 2023, LUNA will be trading at a price point lower than what it was on the above said date at 88. Algods proposition was swiftly taken up by Do Kwon, CEO and founder of Terraform Labs, the firm behind Terra, who also put up the same amount claiming that the cryptocurrency will most definitely be trading at a price point higher than 88 by then. As conversations between the two escalated via Twitter, the duo eventually decided to seek out the services of Cobie, co-host of the crypto podcast UpOnly, who will serve as an escrow agent facilitating the entire agreement. To elaborate, both Kwon and Algod have locked up a total of 1 million each in Tether USDT within an Ethereum address labeled Cobie LUNA Bet Escrow. Cobie LUNA Bet Escrow. Source Etherescan.Kiril Nikolov, head of DeFi strategy at Nexo, a blockchain-based lending platform, told Cointelegraph that while bets like these can gather a lot of attention, they dont really matter in the grand scheme of things. He added that developers will keep on building on Terra regardless of LUNAs price or if Do Kwon loses the bet. A similar opinion is shared by Derek Lim, head of crypto insights for cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, who told Cointelegraph I dont think that we can or should read too much into this. It will be a stretch to think that this wager between private parties can mean anything insidious or bullish. Instead, we should focus on other factors like the sustainability of the projects yield reserve. Daniel Santos, CEO of Woonkly, a decentralized finance- DeFi-based social media network, believes that wagers showcase LUNAs growing popularity. The more popular a project is, the more fans and haters it has. One of the haters placed a bet against LUNA and Terras founder accepted the bet and why not  its that simple, he told Cointelegraph. Is Terras growth really sustainable? While on paper, Terras rise seems extremely impressive, especially with LUNA flipping ETH in terms of staked value and their number of respective token stakers, Nikolov pointed out that theres a major difference in the staking model of the two projects, given the inability of investors to withdraw their staked ETH and its rewards until Ethereum 2.0 is released. Thus, its normal that only a small percentage of all ETH is staked, compared to LUNA, he added. Furthermore, Nikolov noted that Terra has done a great job in recognizing that liquid staking solutions are needed in order to generate stable and composable demand that can further be used for collateral, adding Once the Eth2 merge is complete, we can expect the percentage of staked ETH to become similar to that of LUNA, with liquid staking solutions such as Lido playing the main role of generating utility of the staked ETH, for example, as collateral. Lim believes that Terras existing staking yields are quite sustainable, adding that at a very baseline-type level, the staking rewards generated via the systems Tobin tax and the spread fees from the LUNATerraUSD UST mintburn swaps are very practical. Terras Anchor conundrum The Anchor Protocol ANC, a decentralized lending application built atop the Terra ecosystem currently allows investors in TerraUSD  the platforms native United States dollar-pegged stablecoin  to accrue an annual percentage yield APY of nearly 20. Theoretically, such high interest rates are made possible by the fact that the deposited stablecoins are pooled and lent out to borrowers to accrue interest. Also, in order for an individual to borrow UST, they need to post staked tokens including staked LUNA and staked ETH as collateral. When the earned interest and staking rewards are not able to stay in line with the outlined interest rate of 20  which is the case right now  Anchor is forced to take money from its yield reserve to compensate for the gap existing between its total earnings and payouts. In its current state, Anchor is being manipulated by some savvy users who, over the past few months, have been taking UST loans at an annual percentage rate APR of close to 2.5 and then depositing that same sum back into the Anchor protocol to accumulate 20 profits. Thus, there is a major imbalance within this setup because there is more demand for the 20 yields than for UST borrowers. To help meet these unsustainably high payouts, Anchor has been going through its native reserve pools at a furious pace, as is highlighted by the fact that the protocols crypto coffers, between late December and mid-February, shrunk from 70 million to just a little over 6.50 million. Jack Tao, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Phemex, told Cointelegraph that even though Anchors extremely high yield ratio has helped push the demand for UST and LUNA  with the latters value increasing by 60 over the past month alone  the protocols current APR may be extremely hard to maintain, adding We have to note that the crypto market is highly volatile and these high yield payouts are definitely hard to sustain in the long run, as much of it may be inflated due to speculation. Now that theres more UST in existence than ever, there are already critics that believe LUNA wont be able to sustain its price unless Terra changes its current model. Lim, too, believes that Achors current APR is pretty unsustainable. He pointed out that the protocol functions just like any other money market. If the yield reserve depletes, the APR is adjusted to a sustainable amount  around 1215 per annum  which is pretty good for stablecoins. Terra LUNA six-month price chart. Source CoinGecko.On a more technical note, he stated that there are four key issues facing Anchor that need to be solved immediately in order for the project to move forward in a sustainable manner. These include deposit growth outpacing borrowing, difference in borrowing and spending ratios to maintain an APR of 20, the slow rate at which the protocol allows for the addition of new collateral assets and existing friction between Anchor and other blockchain ecosystems. Nikolov noted that while USTs fluctuating rate of yield reserves on Anchor is unsustainable, it has allowed the stablecoin to become widely adopted. This is something he believes could play a big role in the assets long-term success. The ecosystem needs to continue maturing Santos is of the opinion that most projects entering the crypto market  especially the decentralized finance sector  tend to make use of a high APY model to attract investors, even though they know quite well that these inflated return rates are not very sustainable in the long run. He pointed to Wonderland, a project offering returns in excess of 80,000, which eventually resulted in the projects demise. That said, he does not believe the same will be the case with Terra because the platform offers users a number of use cases as well as a high degree of operational functionality, adding Cardano is a good example, with tons of investors jumping on the ADA train over the last year. A big part of the crypto community was saying that Cardano had nothing to offer, something that LUNA is now facing with its detractors. As we move into a future being driven increasingly by decentralized technologies, it stands to reason that the best way for the sector to grow is through continued maturity. This is to prevent those projects entering the fray from being forced to offer extremely high returns  often bordering on being ridiculous  in order to attract new clients.

Getting your audio player ready... A day after getting into a million-dollar worth bet against a cryptocurrency community member on where LUNAs price will be in a year lower or higher than 88, Terraform Labs CEO has doubled down by putting another 10 million in a new bet. As CryptoPotato reported yesterday, Do Kwon agreed to a 1 million bet against a community member going under the Twitter pseudonym  Sensei Algod. If LUNAs average price on March 13, 2023, is above 88, then Terraform Labs CEO wins the bet and vice-versa. Kwon vowed to donate 1 million to a certain charity regardless of the bets outcome. While putting up a million dollars sounds like a lot to many people, Do Kwon raised the stakes later by answering another challenge. This time, Twitter user  GCR Gigantic Rebirth  wanted to have the same bet over LUNAs price in a year, but he proposed to put up 10 million. Sure, fund cobie s wallet and I will match Gluck  Do Kwon  stablekwon March 14, 2022 Do Kwon responded quickly, and similarly to the first wager, both parties transferred 10 million worth of stablecoins USDT for Terralabs CEO and USDC for GCR to the escrow account owned by the crypto community veteran  Cobie. Keeping in mind that the total amount held in the escrow wallet skyrocketed from 2 million to 22 million in a day, Cobie outlined a new approach on how he plans to address the account.

LFG launched in January to grow the Terra ecosystem and improve the sustainability of its stablecoins. Kwon noted that the funds, denominated in LUNA, will be burned to mint UST to grow the LFGs reserves We will keep growing reserves until it becomes mathematically impossible for idiots to claim de-peg risk for UST. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin with a theoretical exchange rate of 11 with the U.S. dollar and is in part maintained by swapping offor LUNA tokens when its market value deviates from its peg. The burning of 1 in UST results in the minting of 1 in LUNA and vice versa. However, due to high demand for UST on decentralized finance DeFi platforms like Curve Finance, this results in unbalanced pools for swapping stablecoins. For example, as more and more crypto enthusiasts swap their USD Coin USDC and Tether USDT for UST, the pools reserves will deplete and cause price volatility as supply lags behind demand. Two days prior, TFG had already voted on burning the 4.2 million LUNA left in its treasury to protect USTs peg. According to TFG LFG will swap the LUNA to UST swapburnand sell the UST to the Curve pool. The proceeds will go back to LFG reserves to purchase BTC. Thanks to Terras flagship Anchor Protocol, UST is a very popular coin among crypto enthusiasts and promises up to 20 annual yield on UST savings deposits. However, due to an imbalance of depositors and lenders paying interest, the Anchor Protocols reserve for paying the promised yield is still declining, at the time of publication, although it recently experienced a massive capital infusion. If there is any confusion left at this point, we will keep growing reserves until it becomes mathematically impossible for idiots to claim depeg risk for UST UST is mighty httpst.co6xCDPWJUTX Do Kwon stablekwon March 11, 2022 Blockchain Cryptocurrencies Altcoin Business Stablecoin DeFi Terra Curve Finance Add reaction Editors Choice Crypto.com probe by the SEC has officially closed, says CEO Market is underestimating how quickly Bitcoin will hit new ATH Analyst Chernobyl needed to wake people to AI risks, Studio Ghibli memes AI Eye Is Bitcoins future in circular economies or national reserves?

This has boosted the market capitalization of gold-backed crypto tokens to more than 1 billion.Could Bitcoin and altcoins sustain the recovery or will bears reign supreme? Lets analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTCUSDTBitcoin soared above the moving averages on March 9 but quickly retraced the rally on March 10. The bulls are again attempting to push the price back above the moving averages on March 11. This indicates that bulls are buying on dips while bears are selling on rallies.BTCUSDT daily chart.

This equilibrium could tilt in favor of the buyers if they push and sustain the price above 42,594. The BTCUSDT pair could then rise to the overhead zone between 45,000 and the resistance line of the ascending channel.Alternatively, if the price once again turns down from the moving averages, the bears will try to pull the pair below the immediate support at 37,000. If this level gives way, the pair could challenge the support line of the channel. A break and close below this level will increase the possibility of the resumption of the downtrend.ETHUSDTEthers ETH rebound met with stiff resistance at the 50-day simple moving average SMA 2,751 on March 9, indicating that bears are not willing to let go of their advantage easily. The price turned down from the moving averages on March 10 but a minor positive is that the bulls are attempting to defend the support line of the symmetrical triangle.ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewIf the price rebounds off the support line, the bulls will again try to drive and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the ETHUSDT pair could rise to the psychological level at 3,000 and then retest the resistance line of the triangle.This is an important level for the bears to defend because a break and close above it will signal a potential change in trend. This setup has a pattern target at 4,311 on the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below the support line of the triangle, it could indicate the resumption of the downtrend. The pair could then drop to 2,159.BNBUSDTBNB rose above the 50-day SMA 389 on March 9 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The bears took advantage of this situation and pulled the price back below the moving averages on March 10.BNBUSDT daily chart.

This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break below it could clear the path for a decline to 320.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the current level, the buyers will again try to propel and sustain the pair above the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could start its northward march toward 445. XRPUSDTRipple XRP broke and closed above the downtrend line on March 9 but the bulls could not build upon this strength. The bears pulled the price back below the downtrend line on March 10. XRPUSDT daily chart.

A break above this level could clear the path for a rally to the psychological level at 1.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below 0.69.

The pair could then drop to 70.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to push the pair to a new all-time high and toward the target objective at 125.SOLUSDTSolana SOL has been trading inside a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close below the crucial support at 81.

Getting your audio player ready... The Nordic-based financial technology firm  Lunar  closed a 77 million financing round. The organization reached a valuation of 2 billion and introduced a cryptocurrency trading platform. Lunar Dives Into The Crypto Industry The Danish company Lunar secured a 77 million Series D-2 funding round, bringing the series total to 310 million. The investment was led by prominent financial backers such as Heartland, Kinnevik, Tencent, and IDC Ventures. Apart from the financing, via which Lunar surpassed a valuation of 2 billion, the firm revealed the launch of a blockchain arm and a cryptocurrency trading platform. Ken Klausen  Founder and CEO  raised hopes that the initiative will aid customers who struggle to use multiple platforms for their needs. We are excited to bring crypto to our universe of banking, payments, and investments, he emphasized. Initially, Lunars users will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH, Polkadot DOT, Dogecoin DOGE, and Cardano ADA. In addition, Klausen predicted that the future of money is closely connected to Web3 and the Metaverse. Lunars platform will explore how both crypto and blockchain technology can benefit our customers to enter the next level of payments and banking, the exec outlined. Founded in 2015, Lunar stretches its services to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. It received a European banking license in 2019 and currently has over 500,000 customers. The Crypto Environment in Scandinavia The Northern area of Europe, where Lunar is headquartered, is rarely in the spotlight of the cryptocurrency industry. In Denmark, bitcoin and altcoins are allowed to be used as a payment tool, as an asset, and as a good. The government allows locals to use crypto to perform any legal activity, along with the exchanges that support it. However, the governor of Denmarks central bank  Lars Rohde  is not in favor of BTC. Last year, he called it very speculative. At the same time, he argued, there is no stability and no guarantee from any side about the value of cryptocurrencies. Norway treats digital assets the same as any other income or wealth when it comes to personal tax basis. It is safe to say that some of the politicians there are supporters of the sector. For one, Norways Minister of Climate and Environment  Sveinung Rotevatn is a bitcoin HODLer. Sweden, another nation part of the Scandinavian region, has directed its efforts towards launching a central bank digital currency CBDC. Its government has already conducted some research on the matter as the e-krona is expected to see the light of day by 2026.

At its week-to-date WTD low, the Terra token was trading at 75.60.LUNAUSD daily price chart. Source TradingViewOver 120 million LUNA burned alreadyThe recent bout of buying in the LUNA market appeared in part due to similar recoveries elsewhere in the crypto market. For instance, Terras leading competitor in the smart contract space, Ethereum, saw its Ether ETH token rise by 13.50 during the same period. Similarly, Bitcoin BTC also jumped by over 14 from its WTD low below 37,200.Arthur Cheong, founder of DeFiance Capital, hinted on March 9 that LUNA price increased because of Terras ability to capture at least 1 trillion or more worth of decentralized stablecoin market space via its native U.S. dollar-pegged token, TerraUSD UST.The total addressable market size for the de-facto decentralized stablecoin is at least a few trillion dollars.LUNA Arthur  Arthur_0x March 9, 2022 Notably, the supply of UST tokens reached over 1.4 billion on March 9, its highest level to date, according to data from Smart Stake. At the same time, the Terra protocol removed 120 million LUNA tokens from the supply permanently.To recap LUNA maintains USTs dollar peg. So, if the stablecoins price rises above 1, the Terra protocol burns LUNA and mints more stablecoins. Similarly, if USTs price falls below 1, LUNAs valuation declines in tandem due to a slowdown in the burning mechanism.UST vs. LUNA supply in the past 30 days.

Terra also saw the launch of its second lockdrop event and the Mars Protocol helped drive demand for LUNA token. The 1 billion in reserves for UST was also a boon for Anchor Protocol ANC, the Terra-based platform that is the main avenue for minting UST through pledging LUNA or Ether.

Getting your audio player ready... As Terra ascends the ranks of the top ten cryptocurrencies, its popularity as a yield generator continues to soar. It is now the second most staked crypto by value, surpassing even Ethereum 2.0. Staking VS DeFi To be clear, this staked value does not refer to the total value locked in the DeFi protocols on various blockchains. Ethereum still dominates in this arena, with 110 billion locked out of the total 200 billion across all of DeFi. Terra remains at a distant 2nd with 23.7 billion TVL on the network  an all-time high. However, when compared to other proof of stake blockchains, nearly 28 billion worth of LUNA is now devoted to keeping the blockchain functional. That makes it the top chain for staking besides Solana, where 35 billion worth of SOL is staked. Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism that helps prevent a blockchain network from being spammed with invalid transactions blocks. It requires users to lock up their cryptocurrency for a chance to be selected by the network to validate a block. If a validator proposes an invalid block, he loses some of his staked coins. Alternatively, if he presents a block that follows the consensus rules, he is rewarded with all of the transaction fees attached to that blocks transactions. This presents an opportunity for crypto holders on proof of stake networks to earn passive income by simply staking their coins, and creating valid blocks. High-value networks with plenty of activity and transaction fees are especially popular for this. Rewards on Terra Right now, Terra effectively provides a 6.62 annualized reward on staked coins. Thats above Solana and Ethereum 2.0s rewards of 5.93 and 4.81 respectively. These rates are subject to change as network activity rises and falls, or as the staked value on a network increases or decreases. So far 40.65 of eligible Terra is being staked. By contrast, nearly three-quarters of available SOL are staked on Solana. Ethereum is yet to upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, but the deposit contract has collected over 25 billion in Ether so far. This can be expected to increase drastically after the upgrade, which is expected before July of this year. Terras current price is 90.57, with a market cap of over 33 billion.

So when the value of UST goes above 1, Terra incentivizes its users to burn LUNA and mint UST.But when the UST supply contracts, LUNA valuation decreases due to a slowdown in the burning mechanism.

The UST Forex Reserve provides an additional avenue to maintain the stability of the peg in contractionary cycles that reduces the reflexivity of the system, said LFG in a press release published Feb. 22, adding that it could include other major non-correlated assets to the reserve in the future. Jump Crypto, Three Arrows, and other buyers wont be able to sell their LUNA holdings in an open market for at least four years. Terra market outlook Last year, LUNA witnessed incredible price growth due to a boom in UST adoption. Data compiled by Messari showed that the Terra token rose 14,000 in terms of market capitalization while, at the same time, the supply of UST tokens surpassed 10 billion. UST supply vs. LUNA price. Source Messari, Terra AnalyticsThe strong correlation between LUNAs price and USTs growth emerged after the implementation of the Columbus-5 upgrade. The technical tweak decreased LUNAs liquid supply through increased burning and staking and increased the UST supply by expanding its cross-chain prevalence. Related Cointelegraph Consulting The bigger role of LUNA in Terra At the end of 2021, the Terra network had burned about 89 million LUNA tokens worth 5.32 billion at current exchange rates while improving value capture based on the USTs growth. Economically, increases in UST demand simultaneously result in the expansion of the LUNA demand curve and contraction of the LUNA supply curve, noted Will Comyns, a researcher at Messari, adding that increased UST demand would have a great impact on the LUNA supply and price. An excerpt from the article reads If UST adoption continues to grow over time, it is possible that LUNA supply will become essentially fixed at some low level in the future. Burning 100 of seigniorage will dramatically accelerate the reduction of total LUNA supply over time. Murray Rudd, an independent market analyst-cum-economist, noted that LUNA burning in conjunction with USTs demand growth would boost its price to over 200 by the end of 2022 and 920 a year after that. 12 Now the main event - price projections ci90 confidence intervals31 Dec 2022 29.3-b UST market cap 203 160-278 ci31 Dec 2023 70.8-b UST market cap 920 732-1,195 ci and31 Dec 2024 154.8-b UST market cap 7,575 4,441-14,360 ci. pic.twitter.comU4w0PSBu0M Murray Rudd crypto_rudd February 22, 2022 However, one of the flip sides of the bullish outlook is the long-term positive correlation between Terra and Bitcoin.

Backing UST with BTC Terras UST stablecoin TerraUSD is currently the fourth largest stablecoin in the industry, with a market cap of 12.3 billion. Its supply has grown by almost 2,000 since the same time last year, enabling it to surpass DAI. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin with supply growing and shrinking in response to demand. The Terra team pointed out that one common criticism of algorithmic stablecoins is their reflexive nature and the hypothetical risk of a bank run scenario. This has already occurred with other DeFi stablecoins based on similar mathematics. Terra stated that a reserve will help to alleviate such circumstances A decentralized Reserve can provide an additional avenue to maintain the peg in contractionary cycles that reduces the reflexivity of the system. The reserve will initially use BTC, but there are plans to stock it with other non-correlated assets over time. The LUNA tokens purchased by the VC companies will be locked up for a four-year vesting period. Earlier this month, Terra announced a partnership with Major League Baseballs Washington Nationals. LUNA Price Pumps LUNA prices have reacted to the news with a 14.5 surge over the past 24 hours.

The price is near 39,600, which is an important level for the bulls to defend.BTCUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe relative strength index RSI has slipped into the negative territory and the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 41,635 has started to turn down. This suggests that bears are attempting to gain the upper hand.A break and close below 39,600 could increase the selling pressure and the BTCUSDT pair may drop to 36,250.If the price rebounds off the current level, the bulls will again try to push the pair above the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair could gradually rally toward 45,821 but buyers will have to clear this hurdle to signal a possible change in trend.ETHUSDTEther ETH turned down from close to the neckline of the developing inverse head and shoulders pattern on Feb. 16. This suggests that bears are trying their best to invalidate the possible reversal setup.ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe ETHUSDT pair could now drop to the strong support at 2,652. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could open the doors for a further downside to 3,476.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the current level, the bulls will again attempt to push and sustain the price above the neckline. If that happens, it will suggest the start of a new up-move. However, the prospects of such a move look bleak at the moment.BNBUSDTBNB turned down from the 50-day simple moving average SMA 430 on Feb. 16 and broke below the 20-day EMA 408 on Feb. 17. BNBUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe BNBUSDT pair has been consolidating between 390.50 and 445.40 for the past few days. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance will tilt in favor of the bears if the price breaks and sustains below 390.50. That could open the doors for a possible drop to 357.40. Conversely, a break and close above 445.40 could open the doors for a possible rally to 500. Until then, the range-bound action is likely to continue.XRPUSDTThe failure of the bulls to sustain Ripple XRP above 0.85 may have led to profit-booking by short-term traders. That pulled the price down to the strong support at 0.75.XRPUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe buyers are likely to defend the zone between the moving averages. If the price bounces off this support zone, the XRPUSDT pair could rise to 0.85. A break and close above this level could challenge the resistance at 0.91. The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to buyers.This positive view will invalidate if the bears pull the price below the 50-day SMA 0.73. Such a move could trigger several stop-losses, resulting in a possible decline to 0.65 and then 0.60.ADAUSDT Cardano ADA has been sandwiched between the 20-day EMA 1.09 and the psychological support at 1 for the past few days. This tight-range trading is likely to result in a strong directional move within the next few days.ADAUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the bears sink and sustain the price below 1, the ADAUSDT pair could resume its downtrend. The pair could then decline to 0.80 and later to 0.68.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rises from the current level, the bulls will try to drive the pair above the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the channel.SOLUSDTSolana SOL turned down from the 20-day EMA 103 on Feb. 16 and the bears will now try to pull the price below the minor support at 90.72. If that happens, the decline could extend to strong support at 80.83.SOLUSDT daily chart.

A break and close below 80.83 could signal the resumption of the downtrend. The SOLUSDT pair could then drop to the support line of the channel.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the current level, the buyers will try to propel the pair above the 20-day EMA and challenge the resistance line of the descending channel. A break and close above this level will signal that the downtrend could be over.AVAXUSDTAvalanche AVAX broke and closed above the downtrend line on Feb.16 but the bulls could not build upon this advantage. Strong selling by the bears at higher levels has pulled the price back below the downtrend line.AVAXUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe bulls are attempting to defend the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the current level, the buyers will try to push and sustain the AVAXUSDT pair above the downtrend line and 98.77. Such a move will suggest a rally to 117.53.Conversely, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the uptrend line will be tested. A break and close below this support could accelerate selling and the pair may drop to 76.14 followed by a decline to 65.Related XRP mega whales scoop up over 700M in second-biggest accumulation spree in historyLUNAUSDTTerras LUNA token broke and closed above the 20-day EMA 55 on Feb. 15, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.

If they succeed, the pair could rally to the downtrend line of the channel.

Source TradingViewThere is a minor support at 0.13. If the price bounces off this level, the bulls will again try to push the DOGEUSDT pair above the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair could rise to the overhead resistance at 0.17.The flattish 20-day EMA 0.14 and the RSI in the negative zone indicate a minor advantage to sellers. If the price slips below 0.13, the pair could drop to the strong support at 0.12 where the buyers are likely to step in to arrest the decline.DOTUSDTPolkadot DOT turned down from the 20-day EMA 19.82 on Feb. 17, indicating that the sentiment remains negative and traders are defending the overhead resistance levels.DOTUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe bears will now try to pull the price to 16.81, which is an important support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again attempt to drive the DOTUSDT pair above the downtrend line. If they succeed, the pair could rise to 23.19.Alternatively, if bears pull the price below 16.81, the selling could intensify and the pair could extend its decline toward the next support at 10.37. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Source Coin360Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that Bitcoin price has been calmer compared to the Nasdaq 100 Index in 2022. There have been only five occasions this year when Bitcoin has moved more than one standard deviation from its average in either direction, while the Nasdaq 100 has seen 12 such moves. Generally, periods of low volatility are followed by range expansion. Hence, traders may remain cautious because a sharp drop in the Nasdaq 100 could accelerate selling in Bitcoin. Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels. BTCUSDT Bitcoin is attempting to rebound off the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 41,493, indicating that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. BTCUSDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the BTCUSDT pair will complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. The pair could first rally to the psychological level at 50,000 and if this level is crossed, the rally may reach the stiff overhead resistance at 52,088. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies. The pair could then drop to 39,600. The bears will have to pull the price below this support to gain the upper hand. ETHUSDT Ether ETH plunged below the 20-day EMA 2,934 and re-entered the descending channel on Feb. 11, indicating selling at higher levels. A minor positive is that the price has been clinging to the 20-day EMA in the past two days. ETHUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the price breaks and sustains above the 20-day EMA, the buyers will make one more attempt to push the ETHUSDT pair above the overhead resistance zone at 3,283.66 to 3,411.43. If they succeed, the pair will complete an inverted HS pattern. This reversal setup has a target objective at 4,408. On the other hand, if the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies. That will increase the prospects of a drop to the strong support at 2,652. BNBUSDT Binance Coin BNB broke and closed below the 20-day EMA 407 on Feb. 11, indicating that traders who bought at lower levels may be booking profits. BNBUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewHowever, a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the bears to have their way and are buying the dips below 400. The 20-day EMA is flat but the RSI has dropped near 47, suggesting a minor edge to the bears. If the price sustains below 400, the possibility of a drop to 347.40 increases. This negative view will invalidate if the BNBUSDT pair turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average SMA 439. The pair could then start its journey toward the psychological level at 500.

That could pull the XRPUSDT pair to 0.65 and then to 0.60. On the other hand, if the price rises from the current level or rebounds off 0.75, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating near the breakout level. The buyers will then make one more attempt to resume the up-move by pushing the price above the 0.85 to 0.91 resistance zone. ADAUSDT Cardano ADA broke below the 20-day EMA 1.11 on Feb. 11 and has reached strong support at 1. The repeated retest of a support level tends to weaken it. ADAUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears are in control. A break and close below 1 could signal the resumption of the downtrend. The ADAUSDT pair could then drop to 0.80. Contrary to this assumption, if bulls once again manage to defend the 1 support, the pair will attempt to rally above the moving averages.

On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off 80.83, the bulls will try to push the pair to the resistance line of the channel. A break and close above this level will be the first sign that the downtrend could be over.

LUNAUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA 56, which will indicate that the bears may be losing their grip.

Conversely, if bulls fail to push the price above the 20-day EMA within the next few days, the selling could intensify and the LUNAUSDT pair could slide toward the strong support at 43.44.

Bukeles prediction is based on the fact that if the millionaires of the world, who are more than 50 million in number, want to buy at least one Bitcoin, there isnt enough supply to fulfill that demand.Could Bitcoin and the major altcoins end the month on a strong note? Lets study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTCUSDTBitcoin has pulled back in a strong downtrend. In a sliding market, the sentiment is to sell on rallies rather than buy the dips as traders make more money on the downside.BTCUSDT daily chart. Source TradingViewThe first sign of a change in sentiment will be a break and close above the 20-day exponential moving average EMA 39,318. Such a move will indicate that demand exceeds the supply near the 20-day EMA resistance. The BTCUSDT pair could then march toward the 50-day simple moving average SMA 43,791. Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are defending this level aggressively. The pair could then dip to 35,507.01. If this support cracks, the selling could pick up and the price could retest the Jan. 24 low at 32,917.17. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it cracks, the pair could plummet to the strong support at 30,000.ETHUSDTEther ETH is facing resistance near the breakdown level at 2,652 but a minor positive is that bulls have not given up much ground.

The previous Market Insights newsletter tackled Terras ecosystem growth in 2021 and how it got to hundreds of decentralized applications from just two at the beginning of last year. And all of it is grounded on Terras stablecoins and the protocols ability to maintain the stability of their peg. Yet the key ingredient for such stability is its primary staking asset, LUNA. On the surface, investors got to know LUNA because of its rapid price rise in 2021, but according to the projects white paper, owning and holding LUNA is meant to represent something entirely more foundational to the stability of the entire network.LUNA as mining powerTerra is a Tendermint-based blockchain maintained by validators who follow the Tendermint delegated proof-of-stake algorithm and vote on new blocks. Validators run programs called full nodes and are required to stake a certain amount of LUNA tokens to be included in the active validator list, which is made up of 130 validators at the moment. Active validators earn revenue via the transaction fees associated with each block. Those who prefer not to set up full nodes but want to get a share of the validators revenue are called delegators. Delegators are fundamentally stakers who delegate their LUNA tokens to validators in order to increase the weight of staked LUNA. Essentially, LUNA represents the mining power in the Terra network, and the more its economy grows, the more LUNA stakers earn in rewards from fees.LUNA as the volatility absorberAnother critical role of LUNA is maintaining its stablecoin peg. As mentioned, Terras stablecoins follow an algorithmic market module, which means the protocol adjusts its supply automatically based on the markets condition. The protocol is able to achieve this through open market arbitrage incentives.Take the scenario of 1 TerraUSD UST trading above the 1 peg. LUNA holders, in this case, can swap 1 worth of LUNA using the market swap feature of Terra Station and sell it for 1 UST. Then, users can sell this for its equivalent dollar value and profit from the difference. In this regard, the protocol effectively decreases the supply of LUNA and increases the supply of UST, which, with enough volume, could eventually pull it back down to 1. On the flip side, when the price of UST goes below the 1 peg, the protocol incentivizes users to burn UST in exchange for LUNA. This expands the LUNA supply and reduces UST, driving its value back to 1. The volatility in USTs price is, therefore, absorbed through the minting and burning of LUNA tokens. So far, the market has been able to respect the peg even at times when it went as high as 30 from 1. In a year, UST deviated from its peg at an average of about 4. Stable mining demandWith these considerations, it is understandable how crucial LUNAs role is in the Terra ecosystem and how equally important it is to keep mining demand steady. However, Terra is designed in such a way that fees generated from blocks increase along with the expansion of its ecosystem and vice versa. Moreover, the supply of LUNA also shrinks when the Terra network grows since its supply is reduced from minting UST. Because of this, mining rewards would not be as predictable, which could discourage users from staking LUNA since it would make profitability difficult to determine.Achieving stable mining rewardsThe protocols solution is to make the mining rewards more predictable regardless of whether Terra is in a period of contraction or expansion. It uses stability levers in the form of transaction fees and seigniorage or the amount of LUNA burned to achieve this. For instance, when mining rewards are decreasing, indicating a contraction period for Terras economy, the protocol kicks up the LUNA burn rate and increases the fees. This makes LUNA stakers less inclined to abandon staking LUNA altogether.Prior to the Columbus-5 upgrade last year, seigniorage was directed to a community pool to foster more adoption during expansions. Now, all seigniorage are burned, simplifying the economic design of Terra where minting 1 UST means burning 1 worth of LUNA. All fees are also rerouted to staking rewards for LUNA, making staking more attractive as a long-term commitment.Terras creation of decentralized money with a dependable and stable value has encouraged further innovation on its platform. Cointelegraph Researchs upcoming report will take a deeper look at Terras ecosystem, design, community, and a whole lot more.

However, few of these startups are tackling the genre of short storytelling. All except for Dead Handz, a group looking to change the way the world consumes short stories. User-powered storytelling Dead Handz is an Ethereum ETH-based fantasy sci-fi story that users can interact with and invest within. Powered by nonfungible tokens, the team behind Dead Handz aims to build a fantasy world that fans can own a piece of and profit off of its growth. The story will have multiple seasons, each bringing with it a new collection of Dead Handz for users to buy, hold and trade. Taking place in a fictionalized version of Earth, five characters, the activators, have accidentally opened a Portal leading to all sorts of monsters and challenges. The activators must prevent the Portal from spilling its contents onto Earth and taking over the world. Only a few activators are revealed at first, and each one brings additional utility to Dead Handz holders. For example, BC 48 is the curator of the worlds library, which holds lore books, scrolls and other information regarding the universe. Another activator, Professor Khonsu, adds lunar sensitivity to the Dead Handz NFTs. These specialized assets change upon a full moon, creating the worlds first lunar-sensitive NFTs. The backstory of each activator is revealed over time, keeping users engaged and pondering what stories and utility will come next. More insights on dead handz here Genesis, the first Dead Handz season, sold out right away. This initial mint provided the team with sufficient funding to develop token utilities and plan a massive second season, Tartarus. While Genesis Dead Handz holders may have to wait for additional utility, these users are rewarded with one free NFT upon every future season launch as thanks for their support. Scarce storytelling Each Dead Handz season will offer 666 NFTs, creating a level of scarcity with each update. That said, new NFTs will differ drastically from previous seasons offerings. At the start of a new season, the Dead Handz team establishes a theme by which all characters and art directions will abide. Season 2, Tartarus, for instance, is based on Ancient Greek lore, honing in on the mythical Titans from that era. To ensure its NFTs are as accessible as possible, the Dead Handz team has partnered with the Mintable marketplace for trading and investing purposes. Dead Handz has also partnered with Rarity Sniper so users can view the rarity of each NFT and NFT Calendar to promote the launch of the new season. The team describes Dead Handz underlying mission, stating Our ambition is to change the fantasy industry and be the worlds first story with decentralized ownership. The most successful and adored fictional stories are always owned by a small group of individuals or private entities, but it is the fans that fundamentally support them. We believe that fan communities deserve to own a piece of their favorite stories and should profit from their growth.
